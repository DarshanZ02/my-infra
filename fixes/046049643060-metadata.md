**Root Cause:**
The root cause of this security compliance failure is that Instance Metadata Service Version 2 (IMDSv2) is not enforced for EC2 instances at the account level. IMDSv2 is a more secure version of the Instance Metadata Service (IMDS) that helps protect against Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerabilities. By default, EC2 instances can access both IMDSv1 and IMDSv2, which can leave them vulnerable to SSRF attacks. Enforcing IMDSv2 at the account level ensures that all EC2 instances in the account can only access IMDSv2, reducing the risk of SSRF vulnerabilities.

**Detailed Step-by-Step Remediation:**

1. **Sign in to the AWS Management Console** as an administrator or a user with the necessary permissions.
2. **Navigate to the EC2 dashboard** and click on **Account attributes** in the left-hand menu.
3. **Click on the **Instance metadata endpoint** tab.
4. **Select the **Instance metadata service version 2 (IMDSv2)** option.
5. **Click **Save changes** to enforce IMDSv2 for all EC2 instances in the account.

**AWS Console Steps:**

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/
2. Navigate to the EC2 dashboard at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/
3. Click on **Account attributes** in the left-hand menu.
4. Click on the **Instance metadata endpoint** tab.
5. Select the **Instance metadata service version 2 (IMDSv2)** option.
6. Click **Save changes**.

**AWS CLI Commands:**

To enforce IMDSv2 using the AWS CLI, run the following command:
```bash
aws ec2 modify-instance-metadata-options --instance-metadata-options "{\"HttpTokens\":\"required\"}"
```
This command modifies the instance metadata options to require IMDSv2 for all EC2 instances in the account.

**Risk Prevented:**
By enforcing IMDSv2 at the account level, you prevent the risk of Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerabilities, which can allow an attacker to access sensitive data or systems within your AWS account. IMDSv2 provides an additional layer of security by requiring that all requests to the instance metadata service include a valid token, making it more difficult for attackers to exploit SSRF vulnerabilities.
