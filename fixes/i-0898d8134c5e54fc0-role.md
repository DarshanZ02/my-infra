**Root Cause:**
The root cause of this security compliance failure is that the EC2 instance (i-0898d8134c5e54fc0) is not using an IAM instance role to access AWS resources. Instead, it is likely using the root account credentials or a user's access keys, which poses a significant security risk.

**Detailed Step-by-Step Remediation:**

1. **Create an IAM instance role**:
	* Identify the AWS resources that the EC2 instance needs to access.
	* Determine the necessary permissions required for the instance to access those resources.
	* Create a new IAM role with the required permissions.
2. **Attach the IAM role to the EC2 instance**:
	* Once the IAM role is created, attach it to the EC2 instance.
	* This will allow the instance to assume the role and access the required AWS resources.
3. **Update the EC2 instance to use the IAM role**:
	* Ensure that the EC2 instance is configured to use the IAM role for accessing AWS resources.
	* This may involve updating the instance's configuration files or environment variables.
4. **Verify the IAM role is being used**:
	* After updating the EC2 instance, verify that it is using the IAM role to access AWS resources.
	* Check the AWS CloudTrail logs to confirm that the instance is assuming the IAM role.

**AWS Console Steps:**

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the **IAM** dashboard.
3. Click on **Roles** and then **Create role**.
4. Choose **EC2** as the service that the role will be used for.
5. Attach the necessary policies to the role.
6. Click **Review** and then **Create role**.
7. Navigate to the **EC2** dashboard.
8. Select the instance (i-0898d8134c5e54fc0) and click on **Actions**.
9. Click on **Instance settings** and then **Attach/Replace IAM role**.
10. Select the IAM role created in step 3.
11. Click **Apply** to attach the role to the instance.

**AWS CLI Commands:**

1. Create an IAM role:
```bash
aws iam create-role --role-name my-ec2-role --description "IAM role for EC2 instance"
```
2. Attach policies to the IAM role:
```bash
aws iam attach-role-policy --role-name my-ec2-role --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess
```
3. Create an instance profile:
```bash
aws iam create-instance-profile --instance-profile-name my-ec2-profile
```
4. Add the IAM role to the instance profile:
```bash
aws iam add-role-to-instance-profile --instance-profile-name my-ec2-profile --role-name my-ec2-role
```
5. Attach the instance profile to the EC2 instance:
```bash
aws ec2 associate-iam-instance-profile --instance-id i-0898d8134c5e54fc0 --iam-instance-profile Name=my-ec2-profile
```

**Risk Prevented:**
By using an IAM instance role, you prevent the following risks:

* **Unintended access**: Without an IAM role, the EC2 instance may have access to more resources than necessary, increasing the risk of unintended access or data breaches.
* **Credential exposure**: Using the root account credentials or a user's access keys on an EC2 instance increases the risk of credential exposure, which can lead to unauthorized access to AWS resources.
* **Lack of auditing and monitoring**: Without an IAM role, it is more challenging to monitor and audit the activities of the EC2 instance, making it harder to detect and respond to security incidents.
