**Root Cause:**
The EC2 instance (i-0898d8134c5e54fc0) has a security group associated with it that allows inbound traffic from the internet to TCP port 22 (SSH). This allows unauthorized access to the instance, potentially leading to security breaches and data compromises.

**Detailed Step-by-Step Remediation:**

1. **Identify the security group**: Determine which security group is associated with the EC2 instance and allowing inbound traffic to TCP port 22.
2. **Modify the security group**: Update the security group to restrict inbound traffic to TCP port 22, allowing only trusted IP addresses or sources.
3. **Use a bastion host or VPN**: Consider using a bastion host or VPN to securely access the EC2 instance, rather than allowing direct SSH access from the internet.

**AWS Console Steps:**

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
2. Select the "Instances" tab and find the instance (i-0898d8134c5e54fc0) with the security compliance failure.
3. Click on the "Actions" dropdown menu and select "Networking" > "Change security groups".
4. Identify the security group associated with the instance and click on its ID.
5. In the security group details page, click on the "Actions" dropdown menu and select "Edit inbound rules".
6. Find the rule that allows inbound traffic to TCP port 22 and click on the "Edit" button.
7. Update the "Source" field to restrict access to trusted IP addresses or sources (e.g., a specific IP address or a trusted security group).
8. Click "Save" to apply the changes.

**AWS CLI Commands:**

1. Identify the security group ID associated with the instance:
```
aws ec2 describe-instances --instance-ids i-0898d8134c5e54fc0 --query 'Reservations[0].Instances[0].SecurityGroups[0].GroupId' --output text
```
2. Update the security group to restrict inbound traffic to TCP port 22:
```
aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --group-id <security-group-id> --protocol tcp --port 22 --cidr <trusted-ip-address>/32
```
Replace `<security-group-id>` with the actual security group ID and `<trusted-ip-address>` with the trusted IP address or source.

3. Remove the existing inbound rule that allows access from the internet:
```
aws ec2 revoke-security-group-ingress --group-id <security-group-id> --protocol tcp --port 22 --cidr 0.0.0.0/0
```
**Risk Prevented:**
By restricting inbound traffic to TCP port 22, you prevent unauthorized access to the EC2 instance, reducing the risk of:

* Security breaches and data compromises
* Malicious activity, such as hacking and malware injection
* Unintended changes to the instance or its data
* Compliance failures and regulatory penalties

By following these remediation steps, you can ensure that your EC2 instance is secure and compliant with security best practices.
