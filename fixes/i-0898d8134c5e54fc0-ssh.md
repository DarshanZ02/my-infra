**Root Cause:**
The root cause of this security compliance failure is that an EC2 instance (i-0898d8134c5e54fc0) has a security group associated with it that allows inbound traffic from the internet to TCP port 22 (SSH). This means that anyone on the internet can attempt to connect to the instance using SSH, which is a significant security risk.

**Detailed Step-by-Step Remediation:**

1. **Identify the Security Group**: Determine which security group is associated with the EC2 instance and allows inbound traffic on port 22.
2. **Modify the Security Group**: Update the security group to remove the rule that allows inbound traffic on port 22 from the internet (0.0.0.0/0).
3. **Restrict Access**: Restrict access to the EC2 instance by only allowing inbound traffic on port 22 from trusted IP addresses or networks.
4. **Verify Changes**: Verify that the changes have been applied correctly and that the security group no longer allows inbound traffic on port 22 from the internet.

**AWS Console Steps:**

1. Navigate to the AWS Management Console and select the EC2 dashboard.
2. In the navigation pane, choose **Instances** and select the instance (i-0898d8134c5e54fc0) that is associated with the security group.
3. In the **Details** tab, click on the **Security Groups** link to view the security groups associated with the instance.
4. Select the security group that allows inbound traffic on port 22 and click on the **Actions** dropdown menu.
5. Choose **Edit inbound rules** and remove the rule that allows inbound traffic on port 22 from the internet (0.0.0.0/0).
6. Add a new rule that allows inbound traffic on port 22 from trusted IP addresses or networks.
7. Click **Save** to apply the changes.

**AWS CLI Commands:**

1. Describe the security groups associated with the EC2 instance:
```
aws ec2 describe-instances --instance-ids i-0898d8134c5e54fc0 --query 'Reservations[0].Instances[0].SecurityGroups'
```
2. Update the security group to remove the rule that allows inbound traffic on port 22 from the internet:
```
aws ec2 revoke-security-group-ingress --group-id <security-group-id> --protocol tcp --port 22 --cidr 0.0.0.0/0
```
3. Add a new rule that allows inbound traffic on port 22 from trusted IP addresses or networks:
```
aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --group-id <security-group-id> --protocol tcp --port 22 --cidr <trusted-ip-address>
```

**Risk Prevented:**
By remediating this security compliance failure, you prevent the risk of unauthorized access to the EC2 instance via SSH from the internet. This reduces the risk of:

* Unauthorized access to sensitive data stored on the instance
* Malicious activity, such as data tampering or theft
* Lateral movement within the AWS environment
* Compromise of the instance and subsequent use as a launchpad for further attacks

By restricting access to the EC2 instance and only allowing inbound traffic on port 22 from trusted IP addresses or networks, you significantly reduce the attack surface and prevent potential security breaches.
