### Root Cause
The root cause of this security compliance failure is that an EC2 instance (identified by the resource ARN: `arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:046049643060:instance/i-0898d8134c5e54fc0`) has a security group associated with it that allows inbound traffic on TCP port 22 (SSH) from the internet (0.0.0.0/0). This setup allows anyone on the internet to attempt to connect to the instance via SSH, which poses a significant security risk.

### Detailed Step-by-Step Remediation
To remediate this issue, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Security Group**: Determine which security group is associated with the EC2 instance. This can be done through the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI.
2. **Update the Security Group**: Modify the security group to restrict access to TCP port 22. Ideally, access should be limited to specific IP addresses or ranges that need to connect to the instance via SSH.
3. **Apply the Changes**: Ensure that the changes are applied and the security group no longer allows inbound traffic on TCP port 22 from the internet.

### AWS Console Steps
1. Log in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
3. In the navigation pane, choose **Instances** and select the instance identified in the compliance failure.
4. Look at the **Details** tab for the instance and find the **Security groups** field. Click on the security group name.
5. This will take you to the **Security Groups** page. Select the security group associated with your instance.
6. Click on the **Actions** dropdown menu and choose **Edit inbound rules**.
7. Find the rule that allows inbound traffic on TCP port 22 from source `0.0.0.0/0` and either:
   - Delete this rule if it's not needed.
   - Modify the source to a specific IP address or range that requires access to the instance via SSH.
8. Click **Save** to apply the changes.

### AWS CLI Commands
To achieve the same outcome using AWS CLI, you can use the following commands:

1. **Describe the instance** to find its security group ID(s):
   ```
   aws ec2 describe-instances --instance-ids i-0898d8134c5e54fc0 --query 'Reservations[0].Instances[0].SecurityGroups'
   ```
2. **Describe the security group** to find its inbound rules:
   ```
   aws ec2 describe-security-groups --group-ids <SecurityGroupIdFromPreviousStep>
   ```
3. **Update the security group** to modify or delete the inbound rule for TCP port 22:
   - To delete a rule, first find its rule ID:
     ```
     aws ec2 describe-security-groups --group-ids <SecurityGroupId> --query 'SecurityGroups[0].IpPermissions[?IpProtocol==`tcp` && ToPortRange==`22`].Ipv4Ranges[]|[{CidrIp}]'
     ```
   - Then, use the `revoke-security-group-ingress` command (note: this command requires the ID of the rule you want to revoke, which might not be directly available. It's generally easier to use the console for this step or to recreate the security group with the desired rules).
   - Alternatively, to update the rule, you might find it easier to delete the existing rule and then add a new one with the `authorize-security-group-ingress` command:
     ```
     aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --group-id <SecurityGroupId> --protocol tcp --port 22 --cidr <SpecificIpAddressOrRange>/32
     ```
     Replace `<SpecificIpAddressOrRange>` with the IP address or range that should have access.

### Risk Prevented
By restricting access to TCP port 22 (SSH) from the internet, you significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access to your EC2 instance. This is a critical security measure because:
- SSH is a common target for brute-force attacks and dictionary attacks.
- If an attacker gains access to your instance via SSH, they could potentially exploit vulnerabilities, steal data, install malware, or use your instance as a launchpad for further attacks within your network or against other targets on the internet.
- Limiting SSH access to specific IP addresses or ranges ensures that only authorized individuals can attempt to connect to your EC2 instance, greatly enhancing the security posture of your AWS resources.
