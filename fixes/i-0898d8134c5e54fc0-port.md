**Root Cause:**
The root cause of this security compliance failure is that one or more EC2 instances have a security group associated with them that allows incoming traffic from the internet to Cassandra ports (TCP 7000, 7001, 7199, 9042, 9160). This could potentially expose sensitive data and allow unauthorized access to the Cassandra database.

**Detailed Step-by-Step Remediation:**
To fix this issue, we need to update the security group associated with the EC2 instance to restrict incoming traffic to the Cassandra ports. Here are the detailed steps:

1. **Identify the Security Group:** First, we need to identify the security group associated with the EC2 instance. We can do this by checking the instance details in the AWS Management Console or by using the AWS CLI command `aws ec2 describe-instances --instance-ids i-0898d8134c5e54fc0`.
2. **Update the Security Group:** Once we have identified the security group, we need to update its inbound rules to restrict traffic to the Cassandra ports. We can do this by removing any existing rules that allow incoming traffic from the internet to these ports.
3. **Create a New Security Group (Optional):** If the existing security group is being used by other instances or resources, we may want to create a new security group with the updated inbound rules. This will ensure that the changes do not affect other resources.

**AWS Console Steps:**
To update the security group using the AWS Management Console, follow these steps:

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
2. In the navigation pane, choose **Security Groups**.
3. Select the security group associated with the EC2 instance.
4. Choose **Actions**, and then choose **Edit inbound rules**.
5. Remove any existing rules that allow incoming traffic from the internet to Cassandra ports (TCP 7000, 7001, 7199, 9042, 9160).
6. Choose **Save** to save the changes.

**AWS CLI Commands:**
To update the security group using the AWS CLI, use the following commands:

1. Describe the security group: `aws ec2 describe-security-groups --group-ids <security-group-id>`
2. Update the security group: `aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --group-id <security-group-id> --protocol tcp --port 7000 --cidr 0.0.0.0/0 --remove`
   * Repeat this command for each Cassandra port (7001, 7199, 9042, 9160)
3. Create a new security group (optional): `aws ec2 create-security-group --group-name <new-security-group-name> --description <new-security-group-description>`

**Risk Prevented:**
By updating the security group to restrict incoming traffic to Cassandra ports, we prevent the following risks:

* Unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the Cassandra database
* Potential data breaches or exfiltration
* Malicious activity, such as data tampering or ransomware attacks
* Compliance violations, such as non-compliance with regulatory requirements or industry standards

Note: The `Status` is shown as `PASSED`, which implies that the check has already been performed and the issue has been resolved. However, the steps provided above are general steps to remediate the issue if it were to occur.
