The extent to which the criterion is applicable to the cloud service is presented in the system description.The data backup concept specifies which type of data backup is to be carried out (e.g. scope, frequency and duration) and specifies which data shall also be backed up in special cases (e.g. pure use of compute nodes without data storage). When backing up data, one has to distinct between *backups* and *snapshots* of virtual machines. Snapshots do not replace backups but can be part of the backup strategy to achieve Recovery Point Objectives (RPO) if they are additionally stored outside the original data location. The business requirements of the cloud service provider for the scope, frequency and duration of the data backup result from the business impact analysis (cf. BCM-02) for development and operational processes of the cloud service. If different data backup and recovery procedures exist for cloud service customer data and cloud service provider data, both variants should be in scope for tests of controls according to this criteria catalogue. Existing contractual agreements prior to a C5 attestation do not need to be updated to incorporate the requirements specified in this criterion. Instead, new contractual agreements should be designed to ensure that specified requirements are clearly defined and agreed upon with cloud service customers.;Cloud service customers ensure through suitable controls that the contractual agreements made with the cloud service provider regarding the scope, frequency and duration of data retention meet business requirements.

The backup process should ensure that the keys are encrypted during storage and transit to prevent unauthorised access. Regular testing of backup and recovery procedures should be carried out to verify the effectiveness and integrity of the backups. Backups outside a HSM should only be considered after dilligent risk analysis. - Redundant HSMs: Implementing multiple HSMs in geographically dispersed locations to create redundancy to ensure that keys remain available and secure even if one HSM fails. The HSMs should be synchronised to ensure consistency of key material across all devices. Regular health checks and failover tests are necessary to ensure that redundancy mechanisms function correctly.

The cloud service is provided simultaneously from more than two locations. The underlying distributed data centre architecture ensures that the failure of a location or components of a location does not violate the defined availability criteria of the cloud service. Such an architecture can represent an alternative fulfilment (cf. Chapter 3.4.8) of the criterion.

The cloud service is provided simultaneously from more than two locations. The underlying distributed data centre architecture ensures that the failure of a location or components of a location does not violate the defined availability criteria of the cloud service. Such an architecture can represent an alternative fulfilment (cf. Chapter 3.4.8) of the criterion.

Very extensive events which, due to their extent, could affect several sites of the same redundancy group simultaneously or in a timely manner (e.g. floods, earthquakes) are not considered. There are cloud service providers who no longer address the issue of reliability of the cloud service on a physical level through redundancy from two independent locations, but through resilience. The cloud service is provided simultaneously from more than two locations. The underlying distributed data centre architecture ensures that the failure of a location or components of a location does not violate the defined availability criteria of the cloud service. Such an architecture can represent an alternative fulfilment (cf. Chapter 3.4.8) of the criterion. The tests and exercises on functionality required in the criterion also apply analogously to resilient architectures.;Cloud service customers ensure through suitable controls that the existing redundancy model of the cloud service provider and the evidence for the verification of the model comply with their own requirements for the availability and reliability of the cloud service.;FAIL;No CloudTrail trails enabled and logging management events were found.;arn:aws:cloudtrail:eu-north-1:046049643060:trail;046049643060;cloudtrail_multi_region_enabled_logging_management_events;False;C5;Cloud Computing Compliance Criteria Catalogue C5

Exceptions follow a specified procedure.;Cryptography and Key Management (CRY);CRY-05 Data Encryption;Basic;An exception to the requirement that keys are known only to the cloud service customers may be the use of a master key by the cloud service provider. If the cloud service provider uses a master key, the cloud service provider regularly tests the suitability of the design and operating effectiveness of the respective controls. The requirement of 'known to the customer exclusively' means that encryption keys remain solely within the knowledge and control of the owner. This can be addressed by implementing a secure key management system. If a key management system is used, the keys need to be protected from usage not explicitly authorised by the owner of the key and remain inaccessible in plaintext.

It comprises documented methods that allow cloud service customers to securely access and interact with the cloud service, enabling the exchange of data. While these interfaces provide the means for communication with the cloud service, they do not imply that cloud service customers can directly connect their custom systems as if they are natively integrated. Instead, cloud service customers can configure their systems by using methods, such as API calls, and adhering to the specified protocols and data formats provided by the cloud service provider. To ensure seamless and secure communication between interfaces, the cloud service provider uses industry-standard API protocols and implements state-of-the-art transport layer security. The cloud service provider supports cross-platform information processing by employing containerisation technologies and cloud-neutral development frameworks. Infrastructre as Code practices are adopted to standardise infrastructre provisioning. Common data usage policies are defined and enforced to ensure consistent and secure access, utilisation and sharing of data.

Very extensive events which, due to their extent, could affect several sites of the same redundancy group simultaneously or in a timely manner (e.g. floods, earthquakes) are not considered. There are cloud service providers who no longer address the issue of reliability of the cloud service on a physical level through redundancy from two independent locations, but through resilience. The cloud service is provided simultaneously from more than two locations. The underlying distributed data centre architecture ensures that the failure of a location or components of a location does not violate the defined availability criteria of the cloud service. Such an architecture can represent an alternative fulfilment (cf. Chapter 3.4.8) of the criterion. The tests and exercises on functionality required in the criterion also apply analogously to resilient architectures.;Cloud service customers ensure through suitable controls that the existing redundancy model of the cloud service provider and the evidence for the verification of the model comply with their own requirements for the availability and reliability of the cloud service.;FAIL;AWS Organizations is not in-use for this AWS Account.;arn:aws:organizations::046049643060:unknown;unknown;organizations_scp_check_deny_regions;False;C5;Cloud Computing Compliance Criteria Catalogue C5

The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is a technical standard that can be used for assessing the severity of identified vulnerabilities. Scores are calculated based on a formula with several metrics that approximate ease and impact of an exploit. In CVSS version 4.0 the scores can be mapped to qualitative ratings as follows: - Low: 0.1 - 3.9;- Medium: 4.0 - 6.9;- High: 7.0 - 8.9; and- Critical: 9.0 - 10.0. Widely adopted formats on the configuration of system components and cloud services, the existing vulnerabilities, and the available patches and/or mitigation measures include: - Software Bill of Materials (SBOM),- Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) or European Vulnerability Database (EUVD),- Vulnerability, Exploitability eXchange (VEX), and- Common Security Advisory Frameworks (CSAF).

Ideally, the cloud service provider has already ensured the separation of data sets between different customers and between customers and cloud service provider via all other guidelines, instructions and the corresponding measures. The systematic approach of the guidelines and instructions addressed by this criterion ensures that no aspect of this separation is overlooked. It also provides a good basis to explain the cyber security of the cloud service to the customer in an appealing manner (cf. PSS-01). Cloud layers in the sense of this criterion can be found in the *CISA Cloud Security Technical Reverence Architecture*. The cloud service provider may use its own categorisation of cloud layers. There are nine combinations for confidentiality, integrity and availability with prevention, detection and reaction. Applying this to every cloud layer may lead to a large number of combinations. However, depending on the cloud service, it can be acceptable that it may not be possible to provide meaningful information in the guideline for every possible combination of prevention, detection and reaction as well as confidentiality, integrity and availability.

Ideally, the cloud service provider has already ensured the separation of data sets between different customers and between customers and cloud service provider via all other guidelines, instructions and the corresponding measures. The systematic approach of the guidelines and instructions addressed by this criterion ensures that no aspect of this separation is overlooked. It also provides a good basis to explain the cyber security of the cloud service to the customer in an appealing manner (cf.

Audits may be performed as internal audits, sometimes called first party audits, that are conducted by, or on behalf of, the organisation itself. They may also be performed as external audits, generally called second and third party audits. Second party audits are conducted by parties having an interest in the organisation, such as customers, or by other individuals on their behalf. Third party audits are conducted by independent auditing organisations. An audit programme comprises arrangements for a set of one or more audits planned for a specific time frame and directed towards a specific purpose. It may comprise internal and external audits. COM-02 is fully applicable to virtual infrastructure and infrastructure as code. Audit activities might still impact operations in a virtual environment. Reviews of configurations might for example be performed as part of code reviews.;Cloud service customers ensure through suitable controls that appropriate responses are made to malfunctions of the cloud service through such audits.
