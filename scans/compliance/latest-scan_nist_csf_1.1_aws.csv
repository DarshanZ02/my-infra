The framework core contains desired cybersecurity activities and outcomes organized into 23 categories that cover the breadth of cybersecurity objectives for an organization. The profiles contain an organization's unique alignment of their organizational requirements and objectives, risk appetite, and resources using the desired outcomes of the framework core.
