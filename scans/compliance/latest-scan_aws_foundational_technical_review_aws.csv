Have a process in place to periodically audit permissions to the services accessed by an IAM entity. This helps you identify the policies you needto modify to remove any unused permissions.

You can use AWS Resilience Hub to test and verify your workloads to see if it meets its resilience target. AWS Resilience Hub works with AWS Fault Injection Service (AWS FIS) , a chaos engineering service, to provide fault-injection simulations of real-world failures to validate the application recovers within the resilience targets you defined. AWS Resilience Hub also provides API operations for you to integrate its resilience assessment and testing into your CI/CD pipelines for ongoing resilience validation.
