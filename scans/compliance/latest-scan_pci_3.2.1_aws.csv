aws;The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is a proprietary information security standard. It's administered by the PCI Security Standards Council, which was founded by American Express, Discover Financial Services, JCB International, MasterCard Worldwide, and Visa Inc. PCI DSS applies to entities that store, process, or transmit cardholder data (CHD) or sensitive authentication data (SAD). This includes, but isn't limited to, merchants, processors, acquirers, issuers, and service providers. The PCI DSS is mandated by the card brands and administered by the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council.;046049643060;ap-northeast-1;2025-12-03 13:29:30.917549;3.2;If sensitive authentication data is received, render all data unrecoverable upon completion of the authorization process. It is permissible for issuers and companies that support issuing services to store sensitive authentication data if there is a business justification and the data is stored securely. Sensitive authentication data includes the data as cited in the following Requirements 3.2.1 through 3.2.3. Sensitive authentication data consists of full track data, card validation code or value, and PIN data. Storage of sensitive authentication data after authorization is prohibited! This data is very valuable to malicious individuals as it allows them to generate counterfeit payment cards and create fraudulent transactions. Entities that issue payment cards or that perform or support issuing services will often create and control sensitive authentication data as part of the issuing function. It is allowable for companies that perform, facilitate, or support issuing services to store sensitive authentication data ONLY IF they have a legitimate business need to store such data. It should be noted that all PCI DSS requirements apply to issuers, and the only exception for issuers and issuer processors is that sensitive authentication data may be retained if there is a legitimate reason to do so. A legitimate reason is one that is necessary for the performance of the function being provided for the issuer and not one of convenience. Any such data must be stored securely and in accordance with all PCI DSS and specific payment brand requirements.;Requirement 3: Protect stored cardholder data;Requirement 3: Protect stored cardholder data;;;;FAIL;No CloudTrail trails enabled with logging were found.;arn:aws:cloudtrail:ap-northeast-1:046049643060:trail;cloudtrail_multi_region_enabled;False;046049643060;PCI;Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) v3.2.1

Note: It is a relatively trivial effort for a malicious individual to reconstruct original PAN data if they have access to both the truncated and hashed version of a PAN. Where hashed and truncated versions of the same PAN are present in an entity's environment, additional controls must be in place to ensure that the hashed and truncated versions cannot be correlated to reconstruct the original PAN. PANs stored in primary storage (databases, or flat files such as text files spreadsheets) as well as non-primary storage (backup, audit logs, exception or troubleshooting logs) must all be protected. One-way hash functions based on strong cryptography can be used to render cardholder data unreadable. Hash functions are appropriate when there is no need to retrieve the original number (one-way hashes are irreversible). It is recommended, but not currently a requirement, that an additional, random input value be added to the cardholder data prior to hashing to reduce the feasibility of an attacker comparing the data against (and deriving the PAN from) tables of pre- computed hash values. The intent of truncation is to permanently remove a segment of PAN data so that only a portion (generally not to exceed the first six and last four digits) of the PAN is stored. An index token is a cryptographic token that replaces the PAN based on a given index for an unpredictable value. A one-time pad is a system in which a randomly generated private key is used only once to encrypt a message that is then decrypted using a matching one-time pad and key. The intent of strong cryptography (as defined in the PCI DSS and PA-DSS Glossary of Terms, Abbreviations, and Acronyms) is that the encryption be based on an industry-tested and accepted algorithm (not a proprietary or `home- grown` algorithm) with strong cryptographic keys. By correlating hashed and truncated versions of a given PAN, a malicious individual may easily derive the original PAN value.

It is permissible for issuers and companies that support issuing services to store sensitive authentication data if there is a business justification and the data is stored securely. Sensitive authentication data includes the data as cited in the following Requirements 3.2.1 through 3.2.3. Sensitive authentication data consists of full track data, card validation code or value, and PIN data. Storage of sensitive authentication data after authorization is prohibited! This data is very valuable to malicious individuals as it allows them to generate counterfeit payment cards and create fraudulent transactions. Entities that issue payment cards or that perform or support issuing services will often create and control sensitive authentication data as part of the issuing function. It is allowable for companies that perform, facilitate, or support issuing services to store sensitive authentication data ONLY IF they have a legitimate business need to store such data. It should be noted that all PCI DSS requirements apply to issuers, and the only exception for issuers and issuer processors is that sensitive authentication data may be retained if there is a legitimate reason to do so. A legitimate reason is one that is necessary for the performance of the function being provided for the issuer and not one of convenience.

Note: It is a relatively trivial effort for a malicious individual to reconstruct original PAN data if they have access to both the truncated and hashed version of a PAN. Where hashed and truncated versions of the same PAN are present in an entity's environment, additional controls must be in place to ensure that the hashed and truncated versions cannot be correlated to reconstruct the original PAN. PANs stored in primary storage (databases, or flat files such as text files spreadsheets) as well as non-primary storage (backup, audit logs, exception or troubleshooting logs) must all be protected. One-way hash functions based on strong cryptography can be used to render cardholder data unreadable. Hash functions are appropriate when there is no need to retrieve the original number (one-way hashes are irreversible). It is recommended, but not currently a requirement, that an additional, random input value be added to the cardholder data prior to hashing to reduce the feasibility of an attacker comparing the data against (and deriving the PAN from) tables of pre- computed hash values. The intent of truncation is to permanently remove a segment of PAN data so that only a portion (generally not to exceed the first six and last four digits) of the PAN is stored. An index token is a cryptographic token that replaces the PAN based on a given index for an unpredictable value. A one-time pad is a system in which a randomly generated private key is used only once to encrypt a message that is then decrypted using a matching one-time pad and key. The intent of strong cryptography (as defined in the PCI DSS and PA-DSS Glossary of Terms, Abbreviations, and Acronyms) is that the encryption be based on an industry-tested and accepted algorithm (not a proprietary or `home- grown` algorithm) with strong cryptographic keys. By correlating hashed and truncated versions of a given PAN, a malicious individual may easily derive the original PAN value.

It is permissible for issuers and companies that support issuing services to store sensitive authentication data if there is a business justification and the data is stored securely. Sensitive authentication data includes the data as cited in the following Requirements 3.2.1 through 3.2.3. Sensitive authentication data consists of full track data, card validation code or value, and PIN data. Storage of sensitive authentication data after authorization is prohibited! This data is very valuable to malicious individuals as it allows them to generate counterfeit payment cards and create fraudulent transactions. Entities that issue payment cards or that perform or support issuing services will often create and control sensitive authentication data as part of the issuing function. It is allowable for companies that perform, facilitate, or support issuing services to store sensitive authentication data ONLY IF they have a legitimate business need to store such data. It should be noted that all PCI DSS requirements apply to issuers, and the only exception for issuers and issuer processors is that sensitive authentication data may be retained if there is a legitimate reason to do so. A legitimate reason is one that is necessary for the performance of the function being provided for the issuer and not one of convenience.

Note: It is a relatively trivial effort for a malicious individual to reconstruct original PAN data if they have access to both the truncated and hashed version of a PAN. Where hashed and truncated versions of the same PAN are present in an entity's environment, additional controls must be in place to ensure that the hashed and truncated versions cannot be correlated to reconstruct the original PAN. PANs stored in primary storage (databases, or flat files such as text files spreadsheets) as well as non-primary storage (backup, audit logs, exception or troubleshooting logs) must all be protected. One-way hash functions based on strong cryptography can be used to render cardholder data unreadable. Hash functions are appropriate when there is no need to retrieve the original number (one-way hashes are irreversible). It is recommended, but not currently a requirement, that an additional, random input value be added to the cardholder data prior to hashing to reduce the feasibility of an attacker comparing the data against (and deriving the PAN from) tables of pre- computed hash values. The intent of truncation is to permanently remove a segment of PAN data so that only a portion (generally not to exceed the first six and last four digits) of the PAN is stored. An index token is a cryptographic token that replaces the PAN based on a given index for an unpredictable value. A one-time pad is a system in which a randomly generated private key is used only once to encrypt a message that is then decrypted using a matching one-time pad and key. The intent of strong cryptography (as defined in the PCI DSS and PA-DSS Glossary of Terms, Abbreviations, and Acronyms) is that the encryption be based on an industry-tested and accepted algorithm (not a proprietary or `home- grown` algorithm) with strong cryptographic keys. By correlating hashed and truncated versions of a given PAN, a malicious individual may easily derive the original PAN value.

It is permissible for issuers and companies that support issuing services to store sensitive authentication data if there is a business justification and the data is stored securely. Sensitive authentication data includes the data as cited in the following Requirements 3.2.1 through 3.2.3. Sensitive authentication data consists of full track data, card validation code or value, and PIN data. Storage of sensitive authentication data after authorization is prohibited! This data is very valuable to malicious individuals as it allows them to generate counterfeit payment cards and create fraudulent transactions. Entities that issue payment cards or that perform or support issuing services will often create and control sensitive authentication data as part of the issuing function. It is allowable for companies that perform, facilitate, or support issuing services to store sensitive authentication data ONLY IF they have a legitimate business need to store such data. It should be noted that all PCI DSS requirements apply to issuers, and the only exception for issuers and issuer processors is that sensitive authentication data may be retained if there is a legitimate reason to do so. A legitimate reason is one that is necessary for the performance of the function being provided for the issuer and not one of convenience.

Note: It is a relatively trivial effort for a malicious individual to reconstruct original PAN data if they have access to both the truncated and hashed version of a PAN. Where hashed and truncated versions of the same PAN are present in an entity's environment, additional controls must be in place to ensure that the hashed and truncated versions cannot be correlated to reconstruct the original PAN. PANs stored in primary storage (databases, or flat files such as text files spreadsheets) as well as non-primary storage (backup, audit logs, exception or troubleshooting logs) must all be protected. One-way hash functions based on strong cryptography can be used to render cardholder data unreadable. Hash functions are appropriate when there is no need to retrieve the original number (one-way hashes are irreversible). It is recommended, but not currently a requirement, that an additional, random input value be added to the cardholder data prior to hashing to reduce the feasibility of an attacker comparing the data against (and deriving the PAN from) tables of pre- computed hash values. The intent of truncation is to permanently remove a segment of PAN data so that only a portion (generally not to exceed the first six and last four digits) of the PAN is stored. An index token is a cryptographic token that replaces the PAN based on a given index for an unpredictable value. A one-time pad is a system in which a randomly generated private key is used only once to encrypt a message that is then decrypted using a matching one-time pad and key. The intent of strong cryptography (as defined in the PCI DSS and PA-DSS Glossary of Terms, Abbreviations, and Acronyms) is that the encryption be based on an industry-tested and accepted algorithm (not a proprietary or `home- grown` algorithm) with strong cryptographic keys. By correlating hashed and truncated versions of a given PAN, a malicious individual may easily derive the original PAN value.

It is permissible for issuers and companies that support issuing services to store sensitive authentication data if there is a business justification and the data is stored securely. Sensitive authentication data includes the data as cited in the following Requirements 3.2.1 through 3.2.3. Sensitive authentication data consists of full track data, card validation code or value, and PIN data. Storage of sensitive authentication data after authorization is prohibited! This data is very valuable to malicious individuals as it allows them to generate counterfeit payment cards and create fraudulent transactions. Entities that issue payment cards or that perform or support issuing services will often create and control sensitive authentication data as part of the issuing function. It is allowable for companies that perform, facilitate, or support issuing services to store sensitive authentication data ONLY IF they have a legitimate business need to store such data. It should be noted that all PCI DSS requirements apply to issuers, and the only exception for issuers and issuer processors is that sensitive authentication data may be retained if there is a legitimate reason to do so. A legitimate reason is one that is necessary for the performance of the function being provided for the issuer and not one of convenience.

Note: It is a relatively trivial effort for a malicious individual to reconstruct original PAN data if they have access to both the truncated and hashed version of a PAN. Where hashed and truncated versions of the same PAN are present in an entity's environment, additional controls must be in place to ensure that the hashed and truncated versions cannot be correlated to reconstruct the original PAN. PANs stored in primary storage (databases, or flat files such as text files spreadsheets) as well as non-primary storage (backup, audit logs, exception or troubleshooting logs) must all be protected. One-way hash functions based on strong cryptography can be used to render cardholder data unreadable. Hash functions are appropriate when there is no need to retrieve the original number (one-way hashes are irreversible). It is recommended, but not currently a requirement, that an additional, random input value be added to the cardholder data prior to hashing to reduce the feasibility of an attacker comparing the data against (and deriving the PAN from) tables of pre- computed hash values. The intent of truncation is to permanently remove a segment of PAN data so that only a portion (generally not to exceed the first six and last four digits) of the PAN is stored. An index token is a cryptographic token that replaces the PAN based on a given index for an unpredictable value. A one-time pad is a system in which a randomly generated private key is used only once to encrypt a message that is then decrypted using a matching one-time pad and key. The intent of strong cryptography (as defined in the PCI DSS and PA-DSS Glossary of Terms, Abbreviations, and Acronyms) is that the encryption be based on an industry-tested and accepted algorithm (not a proprietary or `home- grown` algorithm) with strong cryptographic keys. By correlating hashed and truncated versions of a given PAN, a malicious individual may easily derive the original PAN value.

It is permissible for issuers and companies that support issuing services to store sensitive authentication data if there is a business justification and the data is stored securely. Sensitive authentication data includes the data as cited in the following Requirements 3.2.1 through 3.2.3. Sensitive authentication data consists of full track data, card validation code or value, and PIN data. Storage of sensitive authentication data after authorization is prohibited! This data is very valuable to malicious individuals as it allows them to generate counterfeit payment cards and create fraudulent transactions. Entities that issue payment cards or that perform or support issuing services will often create and control sensitive authentication data as part of the issuing function. It is allowable for companies that perform, facilitate, or support issuing services to store sensitive authentication data ONLY IF they have a legitimate business need to store such data. It should be noted that all PCI DSS requirements apply to issuers, and the only exception for issuers and issuer processors is that sensitive authentication data may be retained if there is a legitimate reason to do so. A legitimate reason is one that is necessary for the performance of the function being provided for the issuer and not one of convenience.

Note: It is a relatively trivial effort for a malicious individual to reconstruct original PAN data if they have access to both the truncated and hashed version of a PAN. Where hashed and truncated versions of the same PAN are present in an entity's environment, additional controls must be in place to ensure that the hashed and truncated versions cannot be correlated to reconstruct the original PAN. PANs stored in primary storage (databases, or flat files such as text files spreadsheets) as well as non-primary storage (backup, audit logs, exception or troubleshooting logs) must all be protected. One-way hash functions based on strong cryptography can be used to render cardholder data unreadable. Hash functions are appropriate when there is no need to retrieve the original number (one-way hashes are irreversible). It is recommended, but not currently a requirement, that an additional, random input value be added to the cardholder data prior to hashing to reduce the feasibility of an attacker comparing the data against (and deriving the PAN from) tables of pre- computed hash values. The intent of truncation is to permanently remove a segment of PAN data so that only a portion (generally not to exceed the first six and last four digits) of the PAN is stored. An index token is a cryptographic token that replaces the PAN based on a given index for an unpredictable value. A one-time pad is a system in which a randomly generated private key is used only once to encrypt a message that is then decrypted using a matching one-time pad and key. The intent of strong cryptography (as defined in the PCI DSS and PA-DSS Glossary of Terms, Abbreviations, and Acronyms) is that the encryption be based on an industry-tested and accepted algorithm (not a proprietary or `home- grown` algorithm) with strong cryptographic keys. By correlating hashed and truncated versions of a given PAN, a malicious individual may easily derive the original PAN value.

Sensitive authentication data includes the data as cited in the following Requirements 3.2.1 through 3.2.3. Sensitive authentication data consists of full track data, card validation code or value, and PIN data. Storage of sensitive authentication data after authorization is prohibited! This data is very valuable to malicious individuals as it allows them to generate counterfeit payment cards and create fraudulent transactions. Entities that issue payment cards or that perform or support issuing services will often create and control sensitive authentication data as part of the issuing function. It is allowable for companies that perform, facilitate, or support issuing services to store sensitive authentication data ONLY IF they have a legitimate business need to store such data. It should be noted that all PCI DSS requirements apply to issuers, and the only exception for issuers and issuer processors is that sensitive authentication data may be retained if there is a legitimate reason to do so.

Note: It is a relatively trivial effort for a malicious individual to reconstruct original PAN data if they have access to both the truncated and hashed version of a PAN. Where hashed and truncated versions of the same PAN are present in an entity's environment, additional controls must be in place to ensure that the hashed and truncated versions cannot be correlated to reconstruct the original PAN. PANs stored in primary storage (databases, or flat files such as text files spreadsheets) as well as non-primary storage (backup, audit logs, exception or troubleshooting logs) must all be protected. One-way hash functions based on strong cryptography can be used to render cardholder data unreadable. Hash functions are appropriate when there is no need to retrieve the original number (one-way hashes are irreversible). It is recommended, but not currently a requirement, that an additional, random input value be added to the cardholder data prior to hashing to reduce the feasibility of an attacker comparing the data against (and deriving the PAN from) tables of pre- computed hash values. The intent of truncation is to permanently remove a segment of PAN data so that only a portion (generally not to exceed the first six and last four digits) of the PAN is stored. An index token is a cryptographic token that replaces the PAN based on a given index for an unpredictable value. A one-time pad is a system in which a randomly generated private key is used only once to encrypt a message that is then decrypted using a matching one-time pad and key. The intent of strong cryptography (as defined in the PCI DSS and PA-DSS Glossary of Terms, Abbreviations, and Acronyms) is that the encryption be based on an industry-tested and accepted algorithm (not a proprietary or `home- grown` algorithm) with strong cryptographic keys.

Sensitive authentication data consists of full track data, card validation code or value, and PIN data. Storage of sensitive authentication data after authorization is prohibited! This data is very valuable to malicious individuals as it allows them to generate counterfeit payment cards and create fraudulent transactions.

Note: It is a relatively trivial effort for a malicious individual to reconstruct original PAN data if they have access to both the truncated and hashed version of a PAN. Where hashed and truncated versions of the same PAN are present in an entity's environment, additional controls must be in place to ensure that the hashed and truncated versions cannot be correlated to reconstruct the original PAN. PANs stored in primary storage (databases, or flat files such as text files spreadsheets) as well as non-primary storage (backup, audit logs, exception or troubleshooting logs) must all be protected. One-way hash functions based on strong cryptography can be used to render cardholder data unreadable. Hash functions are appropriate when there is no need to retrieve the original number (one-way hashes are irreversible). It is recommended, but not currently a requirement, that an additional, random input value be added to the cardholder data prior to hashing to reduce the feasibility of an attacker comparing the data against (and deriving the PAN from) tables of pre- computed hash values. The intent of truncation is to permanently remove a segment of PAN data so that only a portion (generally not to exceed the first six and last four digits) of the PAN is stored. An index token is a cryptographic token that replaces the PAN based on a given index for an unpredictable value. A one-time pad is a system in which a randomly generated private key is used only once to encrypt a message that is then decrypted using a matching one-time pad and key. The intent of strong cryptography (as defined in the PCI DSS and PA-DSS Glossary of Terms, Abbreviations, and Acronyms) is that the encryption be based on an industry-tested and accepted algorithm (not a proprietary or `home- grown` algorithm) with strong cryptographic keys.

Note: It is a relatively trivial effort for a malicious individual to reconstruct original PAN data if they have access to both the truncated and hashed version of a PAN. Where hashed and truncated versions of the same PAN are present in an entity's environment, additional controls must be in place to ensure that the hashed and truncated versions cannot be correlated to reconstruct the original PAN. PANs stored in primary storage (databases, or flat files such as text files spreadsheets) as well as non-primary storage (backup, audit logs, exception or troubleshooting logs) must all be protected. One-way hash functions based on strong cryptography can be used to render cardholder data unreadable. Hash functions are appropriate when there is no need to retrieve the original number (one-way hashes are irreversible). It is recommended, but not currently a requirement, that an additional, random input value be added to the cardholder data prior to hashing to reduce the feasibility of an attacker comparing the data against (and deriving the PAN from) tables of pre- computed hash values. The intent of truncation is to permanently remove a segment of PAN data so that only a portion (generally not to exceed the first six and last four digits) of the PAN is stored. An index token is a cryptographic token that replaces the PAN based on a given index for an unpredictable value. A one-time pad is a system in which a randomly generated private key is used only once to encrypt a message that is then decrypted using a matching one-time pad and key. The intent of strong cryptography (as defined in the PCI DSS and PA-DSS Glossary of Terms, Abbreviations, and Acronyms) is that the encryption be based on an industry-tested and accepted algorithm (not a proprietary or `home- grown` algorithm) with strong cryptographic keys.

Note: It is a relatively trivial effort for a malicious individual to reconstruct original PAN data if they have access to both the truncated and hashed version of a PAN. Where hashed and truncated versions of the same PAN are present in an entity's environment, additional controls must be in place to ensure that the hashed and truncated versions cannot be correlated to reconstruct the original PAN. PANs stored in primary storage (databases, or flat files such as text files spreadsheets) as well as non-primary storage (backup, audit logs, exception or troubleshooting logs) must all be protected. One-way hash functions based on strong cryptography can be used to render cardholder data unreadable. Hash functions are appropriate when there is no need to retrieve the original number (one-way hashes are irreversible). It is recommended, but not currently a requirement, that an additional, random input value be added to the cardholder data prior to hashing to reduce the feasibility of an attacker comparing the data against (and deriving the PAN from) tables of pre- computed hash values. The intent of truncation is to permanently remove a segment of PAN data so that only a portion (generally not to exceed the first six and last four digits) of the PAN is stored. An index token is a cryptographic token that replaces the PAN based on a given index for an unpredictable value. A one-time pad is a system in which a randomly generated private key is used only once to encrypt a message that is then decrypted using a matching one-time pad and key. The intent of strong cryptography (as defined in the PCI DSS and PA-DSS Glossary of Terms, Abbreviations, and Acronyms) is that the encryption be based on an industry-tested and accepted algorithm (not a proprietary or `home- grown` algorithm) with strong cryptographic keys. By correlating hashed and truncated versions of a given PAN, a malicious individual may easily derive the original PAN value.

One-way hash functions based on strong cryptography can be used to render cardholder data unreadable. Hash functions are appropriate when there is no need to retrieve the original number (one-way hashes are irreversible). It is recommended, but not currently a requirement, that an additional, random input value be added to the cardholder data prior to hashing to reduce the feasibility of an attacker comparing the data against (and deriving the PAN from) tables of pre- computed hash values. The intent of truncation is to permanently remove a segment of PAN data so that only a portion (generally not to exceed the first six and last four digits) of the PAN is stored.

Note: It is a relatively trivial effort for a malicious individual to reconstruct original PAN data if they have access to both the truncated and hashed version of a PAN. Where hashed and truncated versions of the same PAN are present in an entity's environment, additional controls must be in place to ensure that the hashed and truncated versions cannot be correlated to reconstruct the original PAN. PANs stored in primary storage (databases, or flat files such as text files spreadsheets) as well as non-primary storage (backup, audit logs, exception or troubleshooting logs) must all be protected. One-way hash functions based on strong cryptography can be used to render cardholder data unreadable. Hash functions are appropriate when there is no need to retrieve the original number (one-way hashes are irreversible). It is recommended, but not currently a requirement, that an additional, random input value be added to the cardholder data prior to hashing to reduce the feasibility of an attacker comparing the data against (and deriving the PAN from) tables of pre- computed hash values. The intent of truncation is to permanently remove a segment of PAN data so that only a portion (generally not to exceed the first six and last four digits) of the PAN is stored. An index token is a cryptographic token that replaces the PAN based on a given index for an unpredictable value. A one-time pad is a system in which a randomly generated private key is used only once to encrypt a message that is then decrypted using a matching one-time pad and key. The intent of strong cryptography (as defined in the PCI DSS and PA-DSS Glossary of Terms, Abbreviations, and Acronyms) is that the encryption be based on an industry-tested and accepted algorithm (not a proprietary or `home- grown` algorithm) with strong cryptographic keys. By correlating hashed and truncated versions of a given PAN, a malicious individual may easily derive the original PAN value.

PCI DSS applies to entities that store, process, or transmit cardholder data (CHD) or sensitive authentication data (SAD). This includes, but isn't limited to, merchants, processors, acquirers, issuers, and service providers. The PCI DSS is mandated by the card brands and administered by the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council.;046049643060;eu-west-3;2025-12-03 13:29:30.917549;3.2;If sensitive authentication data is received, render all data unrecoverable upon completion of the authorization process. It is permissible for issuers and companies that support issuing services to store sensitive authentication data if there is a business justification and the data is stored securely. Sensitive authentication data includes the data as cited in the following Requirements 3.2.1 through 3.2.3. Sensitive authentication data consists of full track data, card validation code or value, and PIN data. Storage of sensitive authentication data after authorization is prohibited! This data is very valuable to malicious individuals as it allows them to generate counterfeit payment cards and create fraudulent transactions. Entities that issue payment cards or that perform or support issuing services will often create and control sensitive authentication data as part of the issuing function. It is allowable for companies that perform, facilitate, or support issuing services to store sensitive authentication data ONLY IF they have a legitimate business need to store such data. It should be noted that all PCI DSS requirements apply to issuers, and the only exception for issuers and issuer processors is that sensitive authentication data may be retained if there is a legitimate reason to do so. A legitimate reason is one that is necessary for the performance of the function being provided for the issuer and not one of convenience. Any such data must be stored securely and in accordance with all PCI DSS and specific payment brand requirements.;Requirement 3: Protect stored cardholder data;Requirement 3: Protect stored cardholder data;;;;FAIL;No CloudTrail trails enabled with logging were found.;arn:aws:cloudtrail:eu-west-3:046049643060:trail;cloudtrail_multi_region_enabled;False;046049643060;PCI;Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) v3.2.1

Note: It is a relatively trivial effort for a malicious individual to reconstruct original PAN data if they have access to both the truncated and hashed version of a PAN. Where hashed and truncated versions of the same PAN are present in an entity's environment, additional controls must be in place to ensure that the hashed and truncated versions cannot be correlated to reconstruct the original PAN. PANs stored in primary storage (databases, or flat files such as text files spreadsheets) as well as non-primary storage (backup, audit logs, exception or troubleshooting logs) must all be protected. One-way hash functions based on strong cryptography can be used to render cardholder data unreadable. Hash functions are appropriate when there is no need to retrieve the original number (one-way hashes are irreversible). It is recommended, but not currently a requirement, that an additional, random input value be added to the cardholder data prior to hashing to reduce the feasibility of an attacker comparing the data against (and deriving the PAN from) tables of pre- computed hash values. The intent of truncation is to permanently remove a segment of PAN data so that only a portion (generally not to exceed the first six and last four digits) of the PAN is stored. An index token is a cryptographic token that replaces the PAN based on a given index for an unpredictable value. A one-time pad is a system in which a randomly generated private key is used only once to encrypt a message that is then decrypted using a matching one-time pad and key. The intent of strong cryptography (as defined in the PCI DSS and PA-DSS Glossary of Terms, Abbreviations, and Acronyms) is that the encryption be based on an industry-tested and accepted algorithm (not a proprietary or `home- grown` algorithm) with strong cryptographic keys. By correlating hashed and truncated versions of a given PAN, a malicious individual may easily derive the original PAN value.

It is permissible for issuers and companies that support issuing services to store sensitive authentication data if there is a business justification and the data is stored securely. Sensitive authentication data includes the data as cited in the following Requirements 3.2.1 through 3.2.3. Sensitive authentication data consists of full track data, card validation code or value, and PIN data. Storage of sensitive authentication data after authorization is prohibited! This data is very valuable to malicious individuals as it allows them to generate counterfeit payment cards and create fraudulent transactions. Entities that issue payment cards or that perform or support issuing services will often create and control sensitive authentication data as part of the issuing function. It is allowable for companies that perform, facilitate, or support issuing services to store sensitive authentication data ONLY IF they have a legitimate business need to store such data. It should be noted that all PCI DSS requirements apply to issuers, and the only exception for issuers and issuer processors is that sensitive authentication data may be retained if there is a legitimate reason to do so. A legitimate reason is one that is necessary for the performance of the function being provided for the issuer and not one of convenience.

Note: It is a relatively trivial effort for a malicious individual to reconstruct original PAN data if they have access to both the truncated and hashed version of a PAN. Where hashed and truncated versions of the same PAN are present in an entity's environment, additional controls must be in place to ensure that the hashed and truncated versions cannot be correlated to reconstruct the original PAN. PANs stored in primary storage (databases, or flat files such as text files spreadsheets) as well as non-primary storage (backup, audit logs, exception or troubleshooting logs) must all be protected. One-way hash functions based on strong cryptography can be used to render cardholder data unreadable. Hash functions are appropriate when there is no need to retrieve the original number (one-way hashes are irreversible). It is recommended, but not currently a requirement, that an additional, random input value be added to the cardholder data prior to hashing to reduce the feasibility of an attacker comparing the data against (and deriving the PAN from) tables of pre- computed hash values. The intent of truncation is to permanently remove a segment of PAN data so that only a portion (generally not to exceed the first six and last four digits) of the PAN is stored. An index token is a cryptographic token that replaces the PAN based on a given index for an unpredictable value. A one-time pad is a system in which a randomly generated private key is used only once to encrypt a message that is then decrypted using a matching one-time pad and key. The intent of strong cryptography (as defined in the PCI DSS and PA-DSS Glossary of Terms, Abbreviations, and Acronyms) is that the encryption be based on an industry-tested and accepted algorithm (not a proprietary or `home- grown` algorithm) with strong cryptographic keys. By correlating hashed and truncated versions of a given PAN, a malicious individual may easily derive the original PAN value.

It is permissible for issuers and companies that support issuing services to store sensitive authentication data if there is a business justification and the data is stored securely. Sensitive authentication data includes the data as cited in the following Requirements 3.2.1 through 3.2.3. Sensitive authentication data consists of full track data, card validation code or value, and PIN data. Storage of sensitive authentication data after authorization is prohibited! This data is very valuable to malicious individuals as it allows them to generate counterfeit payment cards and create fraudulent transactions. Entities that issue payment cards or that perform or support issuing services will often create and control sensitive authentication data as part of the issuing function. It is allowable for companies that perform, facilitate, or support issuing services to store sensitive authentication data ONLY IF they have a legitimate business need to store such data. It should be noted that all PCI DSS requirements apply to issuers, and the only exception for issuers and issuer processors is that sensitive authentication data may be retained if there is a legitimate reason to do so. A legitimate reason is one that is necessary for the performance of the function being provided for the issuer and not one of convenience.

Note: It is a relatively trivial effort for a malicious individual to reconstruct original PAN data if they have access to both the truncated and hashed version of a PAN. Where hashed and truncated versions of the same PAN are present in an entity's environment, additional controls must be in place to ensure that the hashed and truncated versions cannot be correlated to reconstruct the original PAN. PANs stored in primary storage (databases, or flat files such as text files spreadsheets) as well as non-primary storage (backup, audit logs, exception or troubleshooting logs) must all be protected. One-way hash functions based on strong cryptography can be used to render cardholder data unreadable. Hash functions are appropriate when there is no need to retrieve the original number (one-way hashes are irreversible). It is recommended, but not currently a requirement, that an additional, random input value be added to the cardholder data prior to hashing to reduce the feasibility of an attacker comparing the data against (and deriving the PAN from) tables of pre- computed hash values. The intent of truncation is to permanently remove a segment of PAN data so that only a portion (generally not to exceed the first six and last four digits) of the PAN is stored. An index token is a cryptographic token that replaces the PAN based on a given index for an unpredictable value. A one-time pad is a system in which a randomly generated private key is used only once to encrypt a message that is then decrypted using a matching one-time pad and key. The intent of strong cryptography (as defined in the PCI DSS and PA-DSS Glossary of Terms, Abbreviations, and Acronyms) is that the encryption be based on an industry-tested and accepted algorithm (not a proprietary or `home- grown` algorithm) with strong cryptographic keys. By correlating hashed and truncated versions of a given PAN, a malicious individual may easily derive the original PAN value.

It is permissible for issuers and companies that support issuing services to store sensitive authentication data if there is a business justification and the data is stored securely. Sensitive authentication data includes the data as cited in the following Requirements 3.2.1 through 3.2.3. Sensitive authentication data consists of full track data, card validation code or value, and PIN data. Storage of sensitive authentication data after authorization is prohibited! This data is very valuable to malicious individuals as it allows them to generate counterfeit payment cards and create fraudulent transactions. Entities that issue payment cards or that perform or support issuing services will often create and control sensitive authentication data as part of the issuing function. It is allowable for companies that perform, facilitate, or support issuing services to store sensitive authentication data ONLY IF they have a legitimate business need to store such data. It should be noted that all PCI DSS requirements apply to issuers, and the only exception for issuers and issuer processors is that sensitive authentication data may be retained if there is a legitimate reason to do so. A legitimate reason is one that is necessary for the performance of the function being provided for the issuer and not one of convenience.

Note: It is a relatively trivial effort for a malicious individual to reconstruct original PAN data if they have access to both the truncated and hashed version of a PAN. Where hashed and truncated versions of the same PAN are present in an entity's environment, additional controls must be in place to ensure that the hashed and truncated versions cannot be correlated to reconstruct the original PAN. PANs stored in primary storage (databases, or flat files such as text files spreadsheets) as well as non-primary storage (backup, audit logs, exception or troubleshooting logs) must all be protected. One-way hash functions based on strong cryptography can be used to render cardholder data unreadable. Hash functions are appropriate when there is no need to retrieve the original number (one-way hashes are irreversible). It is recommended, but not currently a requirement, that an additional, random input value be added to the cardholder data prior to hashing to reduce the feasibility of an attacker comparing the data against (and deriving the PAN from) tables of pre- computed hash values. The intent of truncation is to permanently remove a segment of PAN data so that only a portion (generally not to exceed the first six and last four digits) of the PAN is stored. An index token is a cryptographic token that replaces the PAN based on a given index for an unpredictable value. A one-time pad is a system in which a randomly generated private key is used only once to encrypt a message that is then decrypted using a matching one-time pad and key. The intent of strong cryptography (as defined in the PCI DSS and PA-DSS Glossary of Terms, Abbreviations, and Acronyms) is that the encryption be based on an industry-tested and accepted algorithm (not a proprietary or `home- grown` algorithm) with strong cryptographic keys. By correlating hashed and truncated versions of a given PAN, a malicious individual may easily derive the original PAN value.

It is permissible for issuers and companies that support issuing services to store sensitive authentication data if there is a business justification and the data is stored securely. Sensitive authentication data includes the data as cited in the following Requirements 3.2.1 through 3.2.3. Sensitive authentication data consists of full track data, card validation code or value, and PIN data. Storage of sensitive authentication data after authorization is prohibited! This data is very valuable to malicious individuals as it allows them to generate counterfeit payment cards and create fraudulent transactions. Entities that issue payment cards or that perform or support issuing services will often create and control sensitive authentication data as part of the issuing function. It is allowable for companies that perform, facilitate, or support issuing services to store sensitive authentication data ONLY IF they have a legitimate business need to store such data. It should be noted that all PCI DSS requirements apply to issuers, and the only exception for issuers and issuer processors is that sensitive authentication data may be retained if there is a legitimate reason to do so. A legitimate reason is one that is necessary for the performance of the function being provided for the issuer and not one of convenience.

Note: It is a relatively trivial effort for a malicious individual to reconstruct original PAN data if they have access to both the truncated and hashed version of a PAN. Where hashed and truncated versions of the same PAN are present in an entity's environment, additional controls must be in place to ensure that the hashed and truncated versions cannot be correlated to reconstruct the original PAN. PANs stored in primary storage (databases, or flat files such as text files spreadsheets) as well as non-primary storage (backup, audit logs, exception or troubleshooting logs) must all be protected. One-way hash functions based on strong cryptography can be used to render cardholder data unreadable. Hash functions are appropriate when there is no need to retrieve the original number (one-way hashes are irreversible). It is recommended, but not currently a requirement, that an additional, random input value be added to the cardholder data prior to hashing to reduce the feasibility of an attacker comparing the data against (and deriving the PAN from) tables of pre- computed hash values. The intent of truncation is to permanently remove a segment of PAN data so that only a portion (generally not to exceed the first six and last four digits) of the PAN is stored. An index token is a cryptographic token that replaces the PAN based on a given index for an unpredictable value. A one-time pad is a system in which a randomly generated private key is used only once to encrypt a message that is then decrypted using a matching one-time pad and key. The intent of strong cryptography (as defined in the PCI DSS and PA-DSS Glossary of Terms, Abbreviations, and Acronyms) is that the encryption be based on an industry-tested and accepted algorithm (not a proprietary or `home- grown` algorithm) with strong cryptographic keys. By correlating hashed and truncated versions of a given PAN, a malicious individual may easily derive the original PAN value.

It is permissible for issuers and companies that support issuing services to store sensitive authentication data if there is a business justification and the data is stored securely. Sensitive authentication data includes the data as cited in the following Requirements 3.2.1 through 3.2.3. Sensitive authentication data consists of full track data, card validation code or value, and PIN data. Storage of sensitive authentication data after authorization is prohibited! This data is very valuable to malicious individuals as it allows them to generate counterfeit payment cards and create fraudulent transactions. Entities that issue payment cards or that perform or support issuing services will often create and control sensitive authentication data as part of the issuing function. It is allowable for companies that perform, facilitate, or support issuing services to store sensitive authentication data ONLY IF they have a legitimate business need to store such data. It should be noted that all PCI DSS requirements apply to issuers, and the only exception for issuers and issuer processors is that sensitive authentication data may be retained if there is a legitimate reason to do so. A legitimate reason is one that is necessary for the performance of the function being provided for the issuer and not one of convenience.

Note: It is a relatively trivial effort for a malicious individual to reconstruct original PAN data if they have access to both the truncated and hashed version of a PAN. Where hashed and truncated versions of the same PAN are present in an entity's environment, additional controls must be in place to ensure that the hashed and truncated versions cannot be correlated to reconstruct the original PAN. PANs stored in primary storage (databases, or flat files such as text files spreadsheets) as well as non-primary storage (backup, audit logs, exception or troubleshooting logs) must all be protected. One-way hash functions based on strong cryptography can be used to render cardholder data unreadable. Hash functions are appropriate when there is no need to retrieve the original number (one-way hashes are irreversible). It is recommended, but not currently a requirement, that an additional, random input value be added to the cardholder data prior to hashing to reduce the feasibility of an attacker comparing the data against (and deriving the PAN from) tables of pre- computed hash values. The intent of truncation is to permanently remove a segment of PAN data so that only a portion (generally not to exceed the first six and last four digits) of the PAN is stored. An index token is a cryptographic token that replaces the PAN based on a given index for an unpredictable value. A one-time pad is a system in which a randomly generated private key is used only once to encrypt a message that is then decrypted using a matching one-time pad and key. The intent of strong cryptography (as defined in the PCI DSS and PA-DSS Glossary of Terms, Abbreviations, and Acronyms) is that the encryption be based on an industry-tested and accepted algorithm (not a proprietary or `home- grown` algorithm) with strong cryptographic keys. By correlating hashed and truncated versions of a given PAN, a malicious individual may easily derive the original PAN value.

Note: It is a relatively trivial effort for a malicious individual to reconstruct original PAN data if they have access to both the truncated and hashed version of a PAN. Where hashed and truncated versions of the same PAN are present in an entity's environment, additional controls must be in place to ensure that the hashed and truncated versions cannot be correlated to reconstruct the original PAN. PANs stored in primary storage (databases, or flat files such as text files spreadsheets) as well as non-primary storage (backup, audit logs, exception or troubleshooting logs) must all be protected. One-way hash functions based on strong cryptography can be used to render cardholder data unreadable. Hash functions are appropriate when there is no need to retrieve the original number (one-way hashes are irreversible). It is recommended, but not currently a requirement, that an additional, random input value be added to the cardholder data prior to hashing to reduce the feasibility of an attacker comparing the data against (and deriving the PAN from) tables of pre- computed hash values. The intent of truncation is to permanently remove a segment of PAN data so that only a portion (generally not to exceed the first six and last four digits) of the PAN is stored. An index token is a cryptographic token that replaces the PAN based on a given index for an unpredictable value. A one-time pad is a system in which a randomly generated private key is used only once to encrypt a message that is then decrypted using a matching one-time pad and key. The intent of strong cryptography (as defined in the PCI DSS and PA-DSS Glossary of Terms, Abbreviations, and Acronyms) is that the encryption be based on an industry-tested and accepted algorithm (not a proprietary or `home- grown` algorithm) with strong cryptographic keys.

Note: It is a relatively trivial effort for a malicious individual to reconstruct original PAN data if they have access to both the truncated and hashed version of a PAN. Where hashed and truncated versions of the same PAN are present in an entity's environment, additional controls must be in place to ensure that the hashed and truncated versions cannot be correlated to reconstruct the original PAN. PANs stored in primary storage (databases, or flat files such as text files spreadsheets) as well as non-primary storage (backup, audit logs, exception or troubleshooting logs) must all be protected. One-way hash functions based on strong cryptography can be used to render cardholder data unreadable. Hash functions are appropriate when there is no need to retrieve the original number (one-way hashes are irreversible). It is recommended, but not currently a requirement, that an additional, random input value be added to the cardholder data prior to hashing to reduce the feasibility of an attacker comparing the data against (and deriving the PAN from) tables of pre- computed hash values. The intent of truncation is to permanently remove a segment of PAN data so that only a portion (generally not to exceed the first six and last four digits) of the PAN is stored. An index token is a cryptographic token that replaces the PAN based on a given index for an unpredictable value. A one-time pad is a system in which a randomly generated private key is used only once to encrypt a message that is then decrypted using a matching one-time pad and key.

To help those that are not security experts, a number of security organizations have established system-hardening guidelines and recommendations, which advise how to correct these weaknesses. Examples of sources for guidance on configuration standards include, but are not limited to: www.nist.gov, www.sans.org, and www.cisecurity.org, www.iso.org, and product vendors. System configuration standards must be kept up to date to ensure that newly identified weaknesses are corrected prior to a system being installed on the network.;Requirement 2: Do not use vendor-supplied defaults for system passwords and other security parameters;Requirement 2: Do not use vendor-supplied defaults for system passwords and other security parameters;;;;FAIL;EC2 Instance i-0898d8134c5e54fc0 has a Public IP: 18.208.192.153 (ec2-18-208-192-153.compute-1.amazonaws.com).;arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:046049643060:instance/i-0898d8134c5e54fc0;ec2_instance_public_ip;False;i-0898d8134c5e54fc0;PCI;Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) v3.2.1

Multi-factor authentication requires an individual to present a minimum of two separate forms of authentication (as described in Requirement 8.2), before access is granted. Multi-factor authentication provides additional assurance that the individual attempting to gain access is who they claim to be. With multi-factor authentication, an attacker would need to compromise at least two different authentication mechanisms, increasing the difficulty of compromise and thus reducing the risk. Multi-factor authentication is not required at both the system-level and application-level for a particular system component. Multi-factor authentication can be performed either upon authentication to the particular network or to the system component.

Examples of open, public networks include but are not limited to the Internet, wireless technologies, including 802.11 and Bluetooth, cellular technologies, for example, Global System for Mobile communications (GSM), Code division multiple access (CDMA), general Packet Radio Service (GPRS) and satellite communications. Sensitive information must be encrypted during transmission over public networks, because it is easy and common for a malicious individual to intercept and/or divert data while in transit. Secure transmission of cardholder data requires using trusted keys/certificates, a secure protocol for transport, and proper encryption strength to encrypt cardholder data. Connection requests from systems that do not support the required encryption strength, and that would result in an insecure connection, should not be accepted.

Secure transmission of cardholder data requires using trusted keys/certificates, a secure protocol for transport, and proper encryption strength to encrypt cardholder data. Connection requests from systems that do not support the required encryption strength, and that would result in an insecure connection, should not be accepted. Note that some protocol implementations (such as SSL, SSH v1.0, and early TLS) have known vulnerabilities that an attacker can use to gain control of the affected system. Whichever security protocol is used, ensure it is configured to use only secure versions and configurations to prevent use of an insecure connection—for example, by using only trusted certificates and supporting only strong encryption (not supporting weaker, insecure protocols or methods). Verifying that certificates are trusted (for example, have not expired and are issued from a trusted source) helps ensure the integrity of the secure connection. Generally, the web page URL should begin with `HTTPS` and/or the web browser display a padlock icon somewhere in the window of the browser.
