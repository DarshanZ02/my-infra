IAM Access Analyzer is a technology introduced at AWS reinvent 2019. After the Analyzer is enabled in IAM, scan results are displayed on the console showing the accessible resources. Scans show resources that other accounts and federated users can access, such as KMS keys and IAM roles. The results allow you to determine whether an unintended user is permitted, making it easier for administrators to monitor least privilege access. Access Analyzer analyzes only the policies that are applied to resources in the same AWS Region.;AWS IAM External Access Analyzer helps you identify the resources in your organization and accounts, such as Amazon S3 buckets or IAM roles, that are shared with external entities. This allows you to identify unintended access to your resources and data. Access Analyzer identifies resources that are shared with external principals by using logic-based reasoning to analyze the resource-based policies in your AWS environment. IAM External Access Analyzer continuously monitors all policies for S3 buckets, IAM roles, KMS (Key Management Service) keys, AWS Lambda functions, Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service) queues and more;;**From Console:** Perform the following to enable IAM Access Analyzer for IAM policies: 1. Open the IAM console at `https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.` 2. Choose `Access analyzer`. 3. Choose `Create external access analyzer`. 4.

If this is unsuccessful and the account behavior needs urgent mitigation, proactive measures may be taken, including throttling of traffic between the account exhibiting suspicious behavior and the AWS API endpoints and the Internet. This will result in impaired service to and from the account in question, so it is in both the customers' and AWS's best interests that prompt contact can be established.

It is recommended that a metric filter and alarm be established for customer-created CMKs that have changed state to disabled or are scheduled for deletion.;CloudWatch is an AWS native service that allows you to observe and monitor resources and applications. CloudTrail logs can also be sent to an external Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) environment for monitoring and alerting. Data encrypted with disabled or deleted keys will no longer be accessible. Changes in the state of a CMK should be monitored to ensure that the change is intentional.;Creation, storage, and management of CMK may require additional labor compared to the use of AWS-managed keys.;If you are using CloudTrail trails and CloudWatch, perform the following steps to set up the metric filter, alarm, SNS topic, and subscription: 1. Create a metric filter based on the provided filter pattern that checks for CMKs that have been disabled or scheduled for deletion and uses the `<trail-log-group-name>` taken from audit step 1:  ```  aws logs put-metric-filter --log-group-name <trail-log-group-name> --filter-name <disable-or-delete-cmk-changes-metric> --metric-transformations metricName=<disable-or-delete-cmk-changes-metric>,metricNamespace='CISBenchmark',metricValue=1 --filter-pattern '{($.eventSource = kms.amazonaws.com) && (($.eventName=DisableKey)||($.eventName=ScheduleKeyDeletion)) }'  ```  **Note**: You can choose your own `metricName` and `metricNamespace` strings. Using the same `metricNamespace` for all Foundations Benchmark metrics will group them together. 2. Create an SNS topic that the alarm will notify:  ```  aws sns create-topic --name <sns-topic-name>  ```  **Note**: You can execute this command once and then reuse the same topic for all monitoring alarms.  **Note**: Capture the `TopicArn` that is displayed when creating the SNS topic in step 2. 3. Create an SNS subscription for the topic created in step 2:  ```  aws sns subscribe --topic-arn <sns-topic-arn> --protocol <sns-protocol> --notification-endpoint <sns-subscription-endpoints>  ```  **Note**: You can execute this command once and then reuse the same subscription for all monitoring alarms. 4. Create an alarm that is associated with the CloudWatch Logs metric filter created in step 1 and the SNS topic created in step 2:  ```  aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm --alarm-name <disable-or-delete-cmk-changes-alarm> --metric-name <disable-or-delete-cmk-changes-metric> --statistic Sum --period 300 --threshold 1 --comparison-operator GreaterThanOrEqualToThreshold --evaluation-periods 1 --namespace 'CISBenchmark' --alarm-actions <sns-topic-arn>  ```;"If you are using CloudTrail trails and CloudWatch, perform the following to ensure that there is at least one active multi-region CloudTrail trail with the prescribed metric filters and alarms configured: 1. Identify the log group name that is configured for use with the active multi-region CloudTrail trail: - List all CloudTrail trails: `aws cloudtrail describe-trails` - Identify multi-region CloudTrail trails: `Trails with IsMultiRegionTrail set to true` - Note the value associated with Name:`<trail-name>` - Note the `<trail-log-group-name>` within the value associated with CloudWatchLogsLogGroupArn  - Example: `arn:aws:logs:<region>:<account-id>:log-group:<trail-log-group-name>:*` - Ensure the identified multi-region CloudTrail trail is active:  - `aws cloudtrail get-trail-status --name <trail-name>`  - Ensure `IsLogging` is set to `TRUE` - Ensure the identified multi-region CloudTrail trail captures all management events:  - `aws cloudtrail get-event-selectors --trail-name <trail-name>`  - Ensure there is at least one `event selector` for a trail with `IncludeManagementEvents` set to `true` and `ReadWriteType` set to `All` 2. Get a list of all associated metric filters for the `<trail-log-group-name>` captured in step 1:  ```  aws logs describe-metric-filters --log-group-name <trail-log-group-name>  ``` 3. Ensure the output from the above command contains the following:  ```  filterPattern: {($.eventSource = kms.amazonaws.com) && (($.eventName=DisableKey)||($.eventName=ScheduleKeyDeletion)) }  ``` 4. Note the `<disable-or-delete-cmk-changes-metric>` value associated with the `filterPattern` from step 3. 5. Get a list of CloudWatch alarms, and filter on the `<disable-or-delete-cmk-changes-metric>` captured in step 4:  ```  aws cloudwatch describe-alarms --query 'MetricAlarms[?MetricName==<disable-or-delete-cmk-changes-metric>]'  ``` 6. Note the `AlarmActions` value; this will provide the SNS topic ARN value. 7. Ensure there is at least one active subscriber to the SNS topic:  ```  aws sns list-subscriptions-by-topic --topic-arn <sns-topic-arn>   ``` - At least one subscription should have SubscriptionArn with a valid AWS ARN.  - Example of valid SubscriptionArn: `arn:aws:sns:<region>:<account-id>:<sns-topic-name>:<subscription-id>`";Configuring a log metric filter and alarm on a multi-region (global) CloudTrail trail: - ensures that activities from all regions (both used and unused) are monitored - ensures that activities on all supported global services are monitored - ensures that all management events across all regions are monitored;;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudwatch-alarms-for-cloudtrail.html:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/receive-cloudtrail-log-files-from-multiple-regions.html:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/SubscribeTopic.html;FAIL;No CloudWatch log groups found with metric filters or alarms associated.;arn:aws:logs:us-east-1:046049643060:log-group;046049643060;cloudwatch_log_metric_filter_disable_or_scheduled_deletion_of_kms_cmk;False;CIS;CIS Amazon Web Services Foundations Benchmark v5.0.0

Select the region you want to focus on in the top right of the console. 2. Click `Services`. 3. Click `Config`. 4. If a Config Recorder is enabled in this region, navigate to the Settings page from the navigation menu on the left-hand side. If a Config Recorder is not yet enabled in this region, select Get Started. 5. Select Record all resources supported in this region. 6. Choose to include global resources (IAM resources). 7. Specify an S3 bucket in the same account or in another managed AWS account. 8. Create an SNS Topic from the same AWS account or another managed AWS account. **From Command Line:** 1. Ensure there is an appropriate S3 bucket, SNS topic, and IAM role per the [AWS Config Service prerequisites](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/gs-cli-prereq.html). 2. Run this command to create a new configuration recorder: ``` aws configservice put-configuration-recorder --configuration-recorder name=<config-recorder-name>,roleARN=arn:aws:iam::<account-id>:role/<iam-role> --recording-group allSupported=true,includeGlobalResourceTypes=true ``` 3.

However, unrestricted CIFS access can expose your data to unauthorized users, leading to potential security risks. It is important to restrict CIFS access to only trusted networks and users to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches.;Allowing unrestricted CIFS access can lead to significant security vulnerabilities, as it may allow unauthorized users to access sensitive files and data. By restricting CIFS access to known and trusted networks, you can minimize the risk of unauthorized access and protect sensitive data from exposure to potential attackers. Implementing proper network access controls and permissions is essential for maintaining the security and integrity of your file-sharing systems.;Restricting CIFS access may require additional configuration and management effort. However, the benefits of enhanced security and reduced risk of unauthorized access to sensitive data far outweigh the potential challenges.;**From Console:** 1. Login to the AWS Management Console. 2. Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard and select the Security Groups section under `Network & Security`. 3. Identify the security group that allows unrestricted ingress on port 445. 4. Select the security group and click the `Edit Inbound Rules` button. 5. Locate the rule allowing unrestricted access on port 445 (typically listed as `0.0.0.0/0` or `::/0`). 6. Modify the rule to restrict access to specific IP ranges or trusted networks only. 7. Save the changes to the security group. **From Command Line:** 1.

Run the `associate-iam-instance-profile` command to attach an instance profile (which is attached to an IAM role) to the EC2 instance: ``` aws ec2 associate-iam-instance-profile --region <region-name> --instance-id <Instance-ID> --iam-instance-profile Name=Instance-Profile-Name ``` 3. Run the `describe-instances` command again for the recently modified EC2 instance. The command output should return the instance profile ARN and ID: ``` aws ec2 describe-instances --region <region-name> --instance-id <Instance-ID> --query 'Reservations[*].Instances[*].IamInstanceProfile' ``` 4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for each EC2 instance in your AWS account that requires an IAM role to be attached.;First, check if the instance has any API secrets stored using Secret Scanning. Currently, AWS does not have a solution for this. You can use open-source tools like TruffleHog to scan for secrets in the EC2 instance. If a secret is found, then assign the role to the instance. **From Console:** 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the EC2 dashboard at `https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/`. 2. In the left navigation panel, choose `Instances`. 3. Select the EC2 instance you want to examine. 4. Select `Actions`. 5. Select `View details`. 6. Select `Security` in the lower panel.  - If the value for **Instance profile arn** is an instance profile ARN, then an instance profile (that contains an IAM role) is attached.  - If the value for **IAM Role** is blank, no role is attached.  - If the value for **IAM Role** contains a role, a role is attached.  - If the value for **IAM Role** is No roles attached to instance profile: <Instance-Profile-Name>, then an instance profile is attached to the instance, but it does not contain an IAM role. 7. Repeat steps 3 to 6 for each EC2 instance in your AWS account. **From Command Line:** 1. Run the `describe-instances` command to list all EC2 instance IDs in the selected AWS region: ``` aws ec2 describe-instances --region <region-name> --query 'Reservations[*].Instances[*].InstanceId' ``` 2. Run the `describe-instances` command again for each EC2 instance using the `IamInstanceProfile` identifier in the query filter to check if an IAM role is attached: ``` aws ec2 describe-instances --region <region-name> --instance-id <Instance-ID> --query 'Reservations[*].Instances[*].IamInstanceProfile' ``` 3. If an IAM role is attached, the command output will show the IAM instance profile ARN and ID.  4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for each EC2 instance in your AWS account.;;;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_switch-role-ec2.html:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/iam-roles-for-amazon-ec2.html;FAIL;EC2 Instance i-0898d8134c5e54fc0 not associated with an Instance Profile Role.;arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:046049643060:instance/i-0898d8134c5e54fc0;i-0898d8134c5e54fc0;ec2_instance_profile_attached;False;CIS;CIS Amazon Web Services Foundations Benchmark v5.0.0

That user has unrestricted access to and control over all resources in the AWS account. It is highly recommended that the use of this account be avoided for everyday tasks.;The 'root user' has unrestricted access to and control over all account resources. Use of it is inconsistent with the principles of least privilege and separation of duties, and can lead to unnecessary harm due to error or account compromise.;;If you find that the 'root' user account is being used for daily activities, including administrative tasks that do not require the 'root' user: 1. Change the 'root' user password. 2. Deactivate or delete any access keys associated with the 'root' user. Remember, anyone who has 'root' user credentials for your AWS account has unrestricted access to and control of all the resources in your account, including billing information.;**From Console:** 1.

MFA adds an extra layer of protection on top of a user name and password. With MFA enabled, when a user signs in to an AWS website, they will be prompted for their user name and password as well as for an authentication code from their AWS MFA device. For Level 2, it is recommended that the 'root' user account be protected with a hardware MFA. Where an AWS Organization is using centralized root access, root credentials can be removed from member accounts. In that case it is neither possible nor necessary to configure root MFA in the member account.;A hardware MFA has a smaller attack surface than a virtual MFA. For example, a hardware MFA does not suffer the attack surface introduced by the mobile smartphone on which a virtual MFA resides. **Note**: Using hardware MFA for numerous AWS accounts may create a logistical device management issue. If this is the case, consider implementing this Level 2 recommendation selectively for the highest security AWS accounts, while applying the Level 1 recommendation to the remaining accounts.;;**Note:** To manage MFA devices for the AWS 'root' user account, you must use your 'root' account credentials to sign in to AWS. You cannot manage MFA devices for the 'root' account using other credentials. Perform the following to establish a hardware MFA for the 'root' user account: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/). 2. Choose `Dashboard`, and under `Security Status`, expand `Activate MFA` on your root account. 3. Choose `Activate MFA`. 4. In the wizard, choose `A hardware MFA` device and then choose `Next Step`. 5. In the `Serial Number` box, enter the serial number that is found on the back of the MFA device. 6. In the `Authentication Code 1` box, enter the six-digit number displayed by the MFA device. You might need to press the button on the front of the device to display the number. 7. Wait 30 seconds while the device refreshes the code, and then enter the next six-digit number into the `Authentication Code 2` box. You might need to press the button on the front of the device again to display the second number. 8. Choose `Next Step`. The MFA device is now associated with the AWS account. The next time you use your AWS account credentials to sign in, you must type a code from the hardware MFA device. Remediation for this recommendation is not available through AWS CLI.;Perform the following to determine if the 'root' user account has a hardware MFA setup: 1. Run the following command to determine if the 'root' account has MFA setup: ```  aws iam get-account-summary | grep AccountMFAEnabled  aws iam get-account-summary | grep AccountPasswordPresent ``` The `AccountMFAEnabled` property is set to `1` will ensure that the 'root' user account has MFA (Virtual or Hardware) Enabled. `AccountPasswordPresent` set to `0` indicates that the `root` console credential has been removed. If `AccountMFAEnabled` property is set to `0` and `AccountPasswordPresent` is set to `1` the account is not compliant with this recommendation. 2. If `AccountMFAEnabled` property is set to `1`, determine 'root' account has Hardware MFA enabled. Run the following command to list all virtual MFA devices: ```  aws iam list-virtual-mfa-devices  ``` If the output contains one MFA with the following Serial Number, it means the MFA is virtual, not hardware and the account is not compliant with this recommendation:  `SerialNumber: arn:aws:iam::_<aws_account_number>_:mfa/root-account-mfa-device`;IAM User account 'root' for us-gov cloud regions does not have console access.

Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of protection on top of a username and password. With MFA enabled, when a user signs in to an AWS website, they will be prompted for their username and password as well as for an authentication code from their AWS MFA device. **Note:** When virtual MFA is used for 'root' accounts, it is recommended that the device used is NOT a personal device, but rather a dedicated mobile device (tablet or phone) that is kept charged and secured, independent of any individual personal devices (non-personal virtual MFA). This lessens the risks of losing access to the MFA due to device loss, device trade-in, or if the individual owning the device is no longer employed at the company. Where an AWS Organization is using centralized root access, root credentials can be removed from member accounts. In that case it is neither possible nor necessary to configure root MFA in the member account.;Enabling MFA provides increased security for console access as it requires the authenticating principal to possess a device that emits a time-sensitive key and have knowledge of a credential.;;**Note:** To manage MFA devices for the 'root' AWS account, you must use your 'root' account credentials to sign in to AWS. You cannot manage MFA devices for the 'root' account using other credentials. Perform the following to establish MFA for the 'root' user account: 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/). 2. Choose `Dashboard` , and under `Security Status` , expand `Activate MFA` on your root account. 3. Choose `Activate MFA`  4. In the wizard, choose `A virtual MFA` device and then choose `Next Step` . 5. IAM generates and displays configuration information for the virtual MFA device, including a QR code graphic. The graphic is a representation of the 'secret configuration key' that is available for manual entry on devices that do not support QR codes. 6. Open your virtual MFA application. (For a list of apps that you can use for hosting virtual MFA devices, see [Virtual MFA Applications](http://aws.amazon.com/iam/details/mfa/#Virtual_MFA_Applications).) If the virtual MFA application supports multiple accounts (multiple virtual MFA devices), choose the option to create a new account (a new virtual MFA device). 7. Determine whether the MFA app supports QR codes, and then do one of the following:  - Use the app to scan the QR code. For example, you might choose the camera icon or choose an option similar to Scan code, and then use the device's camera to scan the code.  - In the Manage MFA Device wizard, choose Show secret key for manual configuration, and then type the secret configuration key into your MFA application. When you are finished, the virtual MFA device starts generating one-time passwords. In the Manage MFA Device wizard, in the Authentication Code 1 box, type the one-time password that currently appears in the virtual MFA device. Wait up to 30 seconds for the device to generate a new one-time password. Then type the second one-time password into the Authentication Code 2 box. Choose Assign Virtual MFA.;Perform the following to determine if the 'root' user account is enabled and has MFA setup: **From Console:** 1. Login to the AWS Management Console 2. Click `Services`  3.

With MFA enabled, when a user signs in to the AWS Console, they will be prompted for their user name and password as well as for an authentication code from their physical or virtual MFA token. It is recommended that MFA be enabled for all accounts that have a console password.;Enabling MFA provides increased security for console access as it requires the authenticating principal to possess a device that displays a time-sensitive key and have knowledge of a credential.;AWS will soon end support for SMS multi-factor authentication (MFA). New customers are not allowed to use this feature. We recommend that existing customers switch to an alternative method of MFA.;Perform the following to enable MFA: **From Console:** 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at 'https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/' 2. In the left pane, select `Users`. 3. In the `User Name` list, choose the name of the intended MFA user. 4. Choose the `Security Credentials` tab, and then choose `Manage MFA Device`. 5. In the `Manage MFA Device wizard`, choose `Virtual MFA` device, and then choose `Continue`.  IAM generates and displays configuration information for the virtual MFA device, including a QR code graphic. The graphic is a representation of the 'secret configuration key' that is available for manual entry on devices that do not support QR codes. 6. Open your virtual MFA application. (For a list of apps that you can use for hosting virtual MFA devices, see Virtual MFA Applications at https://aws.amazon.com/iam/details/mfa/#Virtual_MFA_Applications). If the virtual MFA application supports multiple accounts (multiple virtual MFA devices), choose the option to create a new account (a new virtual MFA device). 7. Determine whether the MFA app supports QR codes, and then do one of the following:  - Use the app to scan the QR code. For example, you might choose the camera icon or choose an option similar to Scan code, and then use the device's camera to scan the code.  - In the Manage MFA Device wizard, choose Show secret key for manual configuration, and then type the secret configuration key into your MFA application.  When you are finished, the virtual MFA device starts generating one-time passwords. 8. In the `Manage MFA Device wizard`, in the `MFA Code 1 box`, type the `one-time password` that currently appears in the virtual MFA device. Wait up to 30 seconds for the device to generate a new one-time password. Then type the second `one-time password` into the `MFA Code 2 box`. 9. Click `Assign MFA`.;Perform the following to determine if a MFA device is enabled for all IAM users having a console password: **From Console:** 1. Open the IAM console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/). 2. In the left pane, select `Users`  3. If the `MFA` or `Password age` columns are not visible in the table, click the gear icon at the upper right corner of the table and ensure a checkmark is next to both, then click `Close`. 4. Ensure that for each user where the `Password age` column shows a password age, the `MFA` column shows `Virtual`, `U2F Security Key`, or `Hardware`. **From Command Line:** 1. Run the following command (OSX/Linux/UNIX) to generate a list of all IAM users along with their password and MFA status: ```  aws iam generate-credential-report ``` ```  aws iam get-credential-report --query 'Content' --output text | base64 -d | cut -d, -f1,4,8  ``` 2. The output of this command will produce a table similar to the following: ```  user,password_enabled,mfa_active  elise,false,false  brandon,true,true  rakesh,false,false  helene,false,false  paras,true,true  anitha,false,false  ``` 3. For any column having `password_enabled` set to `true` , ensure `mfa_active` is also set to `true.`;"**Forced IAM User Self-Service Remediation** Amazon has published a pattern that requires users to set up MFA through self-service before they gain access to their complete set of permissions. Until they complete this step, they cannot access their full permissions. This pattern can be used for new AWS accounts. It can also be applied to existing accounts; it is recommended that users receive instructions and a grace period to complete MFA enrollment before active enforcement on existing AWS accounts.";;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_mfa.html:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#enable-mfa-for-privileged-users:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_mfa_enable_virtual.html:https://blogs.aws.amazon.com/security/post/Tx2SJJYE082KBUK/How-to-Delegate-Management-of-Multi-Factor-Authentication-to-AWS-IAM-Users;FAIL;User main@darshan has Console Password enabled but MFA disabled.;arn:aws:iam::046049643060:user/main@darshan;main@darshan;iam_user_mfa_enabled_console_access;False;CIS;CIS Amazon Web Services Foundations Benchmark v5.0.0

Run the `update-access-key` command below using the IAM user name and the non-operational access key IDs to deactivate the unnecessary key(s). Refer to the Audit section to identify the unnecessary access key ID for the selected IAM user **Note** - the command does not return any output: ``` aws iam update-access-key --access-key-id <access-key-id> --status Inactive --user-name <user-name> ``` 3. To confirm that the selected access key pair has been successfully `deactivated` run the `list-access-keys` audit command again for that IAM User: ``` aws iam list-access-keys --user-name <user-name> ``` - The command output should expose the metadata for each access key associated with the IAM user. If the non-operational key pair(s) `Status` is set to `Inactive`, the key has been successfully deactivated and the IAM user access configuration adheres now to this recommendation. 4. Repeat steps 1-3 for each IAM user in your AWS account.;"**From Console:** 1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and navigate to IAM dashboard at `https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/`. 2. In the left navigation panel, choose `Users`. 3. Click on the IAM user name that you want to examine. 4. On the IAM user configuration page, select `Security Credentials` tab. 5. Under `Access Keys` section, in the Status column, check the current status for each access key associated with the IAM user. If the selected IAM user has more than one access key activated, then the user's access configuration does not adhere to security best practices, and the risk of accidental exposures increases. - Repeat steps 3-5 for each IAM user in your AWS account. **From Command Line:** 1. Run `list-users` command to list all IAM users within your account: ``` aws iam list-users --query Users[*].UserName ``` The command output should return an array that contains all your IAM user names. 2. Run `list-access-keys` command using the IAM user name list to return the current status of each access key associated with the selected IAM user: ``` aws iam list-access-keys --user-name <user-name> ``` The command output should expose the metadata `(Username, AccessKeyId, Status, CreateDate)` for each access key on that user account. 3. Check the `Status` property value for each key returned to determine each key's current state. If the `Status` property value for more than one IAM access key is set to `Active`, the user access configuration does not adhere to this recommendation; refer to the remediation below. - Repeat steps 2 and 3 for each IAM user in your AWS account.";;;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-access-keys-best-practices.html:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html;PASS;User main@darshan does not have 2 active access keys.;arn:aws:iam::046049643060:user/main@darshan;main@darshan;iam_user_two_active_access_key;False;CIS;CIS Amazon Web Services Foundations Benchmark v5.0.0

If the Security Hub > Summary page is displayed, then Security Hub is set up for the selected region. 4. If presented with Setup Security Hub or Get Started With Security Hub, refer to the remediation steps. 5. Repeat steps 2 to 4 for each region. **From Command Line:** Run the following command to verify the Security Hub status: ``` aws securityhub describe-hub ``` This will list the Security Hub status by region. Check for a 'SubscribedAt' value. Example output: ``` {  HubArn: <security-hub-arn>,  SubscribedAt: 2022-08-19T17:06:42.398Z,  AutoEnableControls: true } ``` An error will be returned if Security Hub is not enabled. Example error: ``` An error occurred (InvalidAccessException) when calling the DescribeHub operation: Account <Account ID> is not subscribed to AWS Security Hub ```;;;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/securityhub-get-started.html:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/securityhub-enable.html#securityhub-enable-api:https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/securityhub/enable-security-hub.html;FAIL;Security Hub is not enabled.;arn:aws:securityhub:us-west-2:046049643060:hub/unknown;hub/unknown;securityhub_enabled;False;CIS;CIS Amazon Web Services Foundations Benchmark v5.0.0
aws;The CIS Amazon Web Services Foundations Benchmark provides prescriptive guidance for configuring security options for a subset of Amazon Web Services with an emphasis on foundational, testable, and architecture agnostic settings.;046049643060;us-east-1;2025-12-03 13:29:30.917549;3.7;Ensure VPC flow logging is enabled in all VPCs;3 Logging;;Level 2;Automated;VPC Flow Logs is a feature that enables you to capture information about the IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in your VPC. After you've created a flow log, you can view and retrieve its data in Amazon CloudWatch Logs. It is recommended that VPC Flow Logs be enabled for packet Rejects for VPCs.;VPC Flow Logs provide visibility into network traffic that traverses the VPC and can be used to detect anomalous traffic or gain insights during security workflows.;By default, CloudWatch Logs will store logs indefinitely unless a specific retention period is defined for the log group. When choosing the number of days to retain, keep in mind that the average time it takes for an organization to realize they have been breached is 210 days (at the time of this writing). Since additional time is required to research a breach, a minimum retention policy of 365 days allows for detection and investigation. You may also wish to archive the logs to a cheaper storage service rather than simply deleting them. See the following AWS resource to manage CloudWatch Logs retention periods: 1. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide/SettingLogRetention.html;Perform the following to enable VPC Flow Logs: **From Console:** 1. Sign into the management console. 2. Select `Services`, then select `VPC`. 3. In the left navigation pane, select `Your VPCs`. 4. Select a VPC. 5. In the right pane, select the `Flow Logs` tab. 6. If no Flow Log exists, click `Create Flow Log`. 7. For Filter, select `Reject`. 8. Enter a `Role` and `Destination Log Group`. 9. Click `Create Log Flow`. 10. Click on `CloudWatch Logs Group`. **Note:** Setting the filter to Reject will dramatically reduce the accumulation of logging data for this recommendation and provide sufficient information for the purposes of breach detection, research, and remediation. However, during periods of least privilege security group engineering, setting the filter to All can be very helpful in discovering existing traffic flows required for the proper operation of an already running environment. **From Command Line:** 1. Create a policy document, name it `role_policy_document.json`, and paste the following content: ``` {  Version: 2012-10-17,  Statement: [  {  Sid: test,  Effect: Allow,  Principal: {  Service: ec2.amazonaws.com  },  Action: sts:AssumeRole  }  ] } ``` 2. Create another policy document, name it `iam_policy.json`, and paste the following content: ``` {  Version: 2012-10-17,  Statement: [  {  Effect: Allow,  Action:[  logs:CreateLogGroup,  logs:CreateLogStream,  logs:DescribeLogGroups,  logs:DescribeLogStreams,  logs:PutLogEvents,  logs:GetLogEvents,  logs:FilterLogEvents  ],  Resource: *  }  ] } ``` 3. Run the following command to create an IAM role: ``` aws iam create-role --role-name <aws-support-iam-role> --assume-role-policy-document file://<file-path>role_policy_document.json  ``` 4. Run the following command to create an IAM policy: ``` aws iam create-policy --policy-name <iam-policy-name> --policy-document file://<file-path>iam-policy.json ``` 5. Run the `attach-group-policy` command, using the IAM policy ARN returned from the previous step to attach the policy to the IAM role: ``` aws iam attach-group-policy --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::<aws-account-id>:policy/<iam-policy-name> --group-name <group-name> ``` - If the command succeeds, no output is returned. 6. Run the `describe-vpcs` command to get a list of VPCs in the selected region: ``` aws ec2 describe-vpcs --region <region> ``` - The command output should return a list of VPCs in the selected region. 7. Run the `create-flow-logs` command to create a flow log for a VPC: ``` aws ec2 create-flow-logs --resource-type VPC --resource-ids <vpc-id> --traffic-type REJECT --log-group-name <log-group-name> --deliver-logs-permission-arn <iam-role-arn> ``` 8. Repeat step 7 for other VPCs in the selected region. 9. Change the region by updating --region, and repeat the remediation procedure for each region.;Perform the following to determine if VPC Flow logs are enabled: **From Console:** 1. Sign into the management console. 2. Select `Services`, then select `VPC`. 3. In the left navigation pane, select `Your VPCs`. 4. Select a VPC. 5. In the right pane, select the `Flow Logs` tab. 6. Ensure a Log Flow exists that has `Active` in the `Status` column. **From Command Line:** 1. Run the `describe-vpcs` command (OSX/Linux/UNIX) to list the VPC networks available in the current AWS region: ``` aws ec2 describe-vpcs --region <region> --query Vpcs[].VpcId ``` 2. The command output returns the `VpcId` of VPCs available in the selected region. 3. Run the `describe-flow-logs` command (OSX/Linux/UNIX) using the VPC ID to determine if the selected virtual network has the Flow Logs feature enabled: ``` aws ec2 describe-flow-logs --filter Name=resource-id,Values=<vpc-id> ``` - If there are no Flow Logs created for the selected VPC, the command output will return an empty list `[]`. 4. Repeat step 3 for other VPCs in the same region. 5. Change the region by updating `--region`, and repeat steps 1-4 for each region.;;;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/flow-logs.html;FAIL;VPC vpc-05b938e567acef187 Flow logs are disabled.;arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:046049643060:vpc/vpc-05b938e567acef187;vpc-05b938e567acef187;vpc_flow_logs_enabled;False;CIS;CIS Amazon Web Services Foundations Benchmark v5.0.0
