However, simply analyzing collected data and manually processing information is insufficient to keep up with the volume of information flowing from complex architectures. Analysis and reporting alone don't facilitate the assignment of the right resources to work an event in a timely fashion. A best practice for building a mature security operations team is to deeply integrate the flow of security events and findings into a notification and workflow system such as a ticketing system, a bug or issue system, or other security information and event management (SIEM) system. This takes the workflow out of email and static reports, and allows you to route, escalate, and manage events or findings. Many organizations are also integrating security alerts into their chat or collaboration, and developer productivity platforms. For organizations embarking on automation, an API-driven, low-latency ticketing system offers considerable flexibility when planning what to automate first. This best practice applies not only to security events generated from log messages depicting user activity or network events, but also from changes detected in the infrastructure itself. The ability to detect change, determine whether a change was appropriate, and then route that information to the correct remediation workflow is essential in maintaining and validating a secure architecture, in the context of changes where the nature of their undesirability is sufficiently subtle that their execution cannot currently be prevented with a combination of AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) and AWS Organizations configuration.

This service provides a scalable rules engine designed to broker both native AWS event formats (such as AWS CloudTrail events), as well as custom events you can generate from your application. Amazon GuardDuty also allows you to route events to a workflow system for those building incident response systems (AWS Step Functions), or to a central Security Account, or to a bucket for further analysis. Detecting change and routing this information to the correct workflow can also be accomplished using AWS Config Rules and Conformance Packs. AWS Config detects changes to in-scope services (though with higher latency than EventBridge) and generates events that can be parsed using AWS Config Rules for rollback, enforcement of compliance policy, and forwarding of information to systems, such as change management platforms and operational ticketing systems. As well as writing your own Lambda functions to respond to AWS Config events, you can also take advantage of the AWS Config Rules Development Kit, and a library of open source AWS Config Rules.

A best practice for building a mature security operations team is to deeply integrate the flow of security events and findings into a notification and workflow system such as a ticketing system, a bug or issue system, or other security information and event management (SIEM) system.

However, simply analyzing collected data and manually processing information is insufficient to keep up with the volume of information flowing from complex architectures. Analysis and reporting alone don't facilitate the assignment of the right resources to work an event in a timely fashion. A best practice for building a mature security operations team is to deeply integrate the flow of security events and findings into a notification and workflow system such as a ticketing system, a bug or issue system, or other security information and event management (SIEM) system. This takes the workflow out of email and static reports, and allows you to route, escalate, and manage events or findings. Many organizations are also integrating security alerts into their chat or collaboration, and developer productivity platforms. For organizations embarking on automation, an API-driven, low-latency ticketing system offers considerable flexibility when planning what to automate first. This best practice applies not only to security events generated from log messages depicting user activity or network events, but also from changes detected in the infrastructure itself.

In AWS, investigating events of interest and information on potentially unexpected changes into an automated workflow can be achieved using Amazon EventBridge. This service provides a scalable rules engine designed to broker both native AWS event formats (such as AWS CloudTrail events), as well as custom events you can generate from your application. Amazon GuardDuty also allows you to route events to a workflow system for those building incident response systems (AWS Step Functions), or to a central Security Account, or to a bucket for further analysis. Detecting change and routing this information to the correct workflow can also be accomplished using AWS Config Rules and Conformance Packs. AWS Config detects changes to in-scope services (though with higher latency than EventBridge) and generates events that can be parsed using AWS Config Rules for rollback, enforcement of compliance policy, and forwarding of information to systems, such as change management platforms and operational ticketing systems.

However, simply analyzing collected data and manually processing information is insufficient to keep up with the volume of information flowing from complex architectures. Analysis and reporting alone don't facilitate the assignment of the right resources to work an event in a timely fashion. A best practice for building a mature security operations team is to deeply integrate the flow of security events and findings into a notification and workflow system such as a ticketing system, a bug or issue system, or other security information and event management (SIEM) system. This takes the workflow out of email and static reports, and allows you to route, escalate, and manage events or findings.

However, simply analyzing collected data and manually processing information is insufficient to keep up with the volume of information flowing from complex architectures. Analysis and reporting alone don't facilitate the assignment of the right resources to work an event in a timely fashion. A best practice for building a mature security operations team is to deeply integrate the flow of security events and findings into a notification and workflow system such as a ticketing system, a bug or issue system, or other security information and event management (SIEM) system.

A best practice for building a mature security operations team is to deeply integrate the flow of security events and findings into a notification and workflow system such as a ticketing system, a bug or issue system, or other security information and event management (SIEM) system. This takes the workflow out of email and static reports, and allows you to route, escalate, and manage events or findings. Many organizations are also integrating security alerts into their chat or collaboration, and developer productivity platforms. For organizations embarking on automation, an API-driven, low-latency ticketing system offers considerable flexibility when planning what to automate first. This best practice applies not only to security events generated from log messages depicting user activity or network events, but also from changes detected in the infrastructure itself. The ability to detect change, determine whether a change was appropriate, and then route that information to the correct remediation workflow is essential in maintaining and validating a secure architecture, in the context of changes where the nature of their undesirability is sufficiently subtle that their execution cannot currently be prevented with a combination of AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) and AWS Organizations configuration.

However, simply analyzing collected data and manually processing information is insufficient to keep up with the volume of information flowing from complex architectures. Analysis and reporting alone don't facilitate the assignment of the right resources to work an event in a timely fashion. A best practice for building a mature security operations team is to deeply integrate the flow of security events and findings into a notification and workflow system such as a ticketing system, a bug or issue system, or other security information and event management (SIEM) system. This takes the workflow out of email and static reports, and allows you to route, escalate, and manage events or findings. Many organizations are also integrating security alerts into their chat or collaboration, and developer productivity platforms. For organizations embarking on automation, an API-driven, low-latency ticketing system offers considerable flexibility when planning what to automate first. This best practice applies not only to security events generated from log messages depicting user activity or network events, but also from changes detected in the infrastructure itself. The ability to detect change, determine whether a change was appropriate, and then route that information to the correct remediation workflow is essential in maintaining and validating a secure architecture, in the context of changes where the nature of their undesirability is sufficiently subtle that their execution cannot currently be prevented with a combination of AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) and AWS Organizations configuration.

For example, if a component requires internet accessibility (inbound and outbound), connectivity to VPCs, edge services, and external data centers. A VPC allows you to define your network topology that spans an AWS Region with a private IPv4 address range that you set, or an IPv6 address range AWS selects. You should apply multiple controls with a defense in depth approach for both inbound and outbound traffic, including the use of security groups (stateful inspection firewall), Network ACLs, subnets, and route tables. Within a VPC, you can create subnets in an Availability Zone. Each subnet can have an associated route table that defines routing rules for managing the paths that traffic takes within the subnet. You can define an internet routable subnet by having a route that goes to an internet or NAT gateway attached to the VPC, or through another VPC. When an instance, Amazon Relational Database Service(Amazon RDS) database, or other service is launched within a VPC, it has its own security group per network interface. This firewall is outside the operating system layer and can be used to define rules for allowed inbound and outbound traffic. You can also define relationships between security groups. For example, instances within a database tier security group only accept traffic from instances within the application tier, by reference to the security groups applied to the instances involved. Unless you are using non-TCP protocols, it shouldn't be necessary to have an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud(Amazon EC2) instance directly accessible by the internet (even with ports restricted by security groups) without a load balancer, or CloudFront. This helps protect it from unintended access through an operating system or application issue. A subnet can also have a network ACL attached to it, which acts as a stateless firewall. You should configure the network ACL to narrow the scope of traffic allowed between layers, note that you need to define both inbound and outbound rules.

We recommend you use this approach to access AWS services, third-party services, and your own services hosted in other VPCs securely.

You can inspect your VPC configurations for potential unintended access using VPC Network Access Analyzer. You can specify your network access requirements and identify potential network paths that do not meet them. For components transacting over HTTP-based protocols, a web application firewall can help protect from common attacks. AWS WAF is a web application firewall that lets you monitor and block HTTP(s) requests that match your configurable rules that are forwarded to an Amazon API Gateway API, Amazon CloudFront, or an Application Load Balancer. To get started with AWS WAF, you can use AWS Managed Rules in combination with your own, or use existing partner integrations. For managing AWS WAF, AWS Shield Advanced protections, and Amazon VPC security groups across AWS Organizations, you can use AWS Firewall Manager. It allows you to centrally configure and manage firewall rules across your accounts and applications, making it easier to scale enforcement of common rules. It also enables you to rapidly respond to attacks, using AWS Shield Advanced, or solutions that can automatically block unwanted requests to your web applications. Firewall Manager also works with AWS Network Firewall.

This makes it easier to manage access across multiple applications and services, because you are creating, managing, and revoking access from a single location. For example, if someone leaves your organization, you can revoke access for all applications and services (including AWS) from one location. This reduces the need for multiple credentials and provides an opportunity to integrate with existing human resources (HR) processes. For federation with individual AWS accounts, you can use centralized identities for AWS with a SAML 2.0-based provider with AWS Identity and Access Management. You can use any provider— whether hosted by you in AWS, external to AWS, or supplied by the AWS Partner—that is compatible with the SAML 2.0 protocol. You can use federation between your AWS account and your chosen provider to grant a user or application access to call AWS API operations by using a SAML assertion to get temporary security credentials. Web-based single sign-on is also supported, allowing users to sign in to the AWS Management Console from your sign in website. For federation to multiple accounts in your AWS Organizations, you can configure your identity source in AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS Single Sign-On) (IAM Identity Center), and specify where your users and groups are stored. Once configured, your identity provider is your source of truth, and information can be synchronized using the System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) v2.0 protocol. You can then look up users or groups and grant them IAM Identity Center access to AWS accounts, cloud applications, or both. IAM Identity Center integrates with AWS Organizations, which enables you to configure your identity provider once and then grant access to existing and new accounts managed in your organization. IAM Identity Center provides you with a default store, which you can use to manage your users and groups. If you choose to use the IAM Identity Center store, create your users and groups and assign their level of access to your AWS accounts and applications, keeping in mind the best practice of least privilege.

This makes it easier to manage access across multiple applications and services, because you are creating, managing, and revoking access from a single location. For example, if someone leaves your organization, you can revoke access for all applications and services (including AWS) from one location. This reduces the need for multiple credentials and provides an opportunity to integrate with existing human resources (HR) processes. For federation with individual AWS accounts, you can use centralized identities for AWS with a SAML 2.0-based provider with AWS Identity and Access Management. You can use any provider— whether hosted by you in AWS, external to AWS, or supplied by the AWS Partner—that is compatible with the SAML 2.0 protocol. You can use federation between your AWS account and your chosen provider to grant a user or application access to call AWS API operations by using a SAML assertion to get temporary security credentials. Web-based single sign-on is also supported, allowing users to sign in to the AWS Management Console from your sign in website. For federation to multiple accounts in your AWS Organizations, you can configure your identity source in AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS Single Sign-On) (IAM Identity Center), and specify where your users and groups are stored. Once configured, your identity provider is your source of truth, and information can be synchronized using the System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) v2.0 protocol. You can then look up users or groups and grant them IAM Identity Center access to AWS accounts, cloud applications, or both. IAM Identity Center integrates with AWS Organizations, which enables you to configure your identity provider once and then grant access to existing and new accounts managed in your organization. IAM Identity Center provides you with a default store, which you can use to manage your users and groups. If you choose to use the IAM Identity Center store, create your users and groups and assign their level of access to your AWS accounts and applications, keeping in mind the best practice of least privilege.

A best practice for building a mature security operations team is to deeply integrate the flow of security events and findings into a notification and workflow system such as a ticketing system, a bug or issue system, or other security information and event management (SIEM) system.

Be aware, though, that once an instance has been compromised, no responses from tools or agents running on it should be considered trustworthy.;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/sec_incident_response_pre_deploy_tools.html#implementation-guidance.;MANUAL;Manual check;manual_check;manual;False;Manual check;AWS-Well-Architected-Framework-Security-Pillar;AWS Well-Architected Framework Security Pillar

These events should exercise responders using the same tools and techniques that would be used in a real-world scenario - even mimicking real-world environments. Game days are fundamentally about being prepared and iteratively improving your response capabilities. Some of the reasons you might find value in performing game day activities include:Validating readinessDeveloping confidence – learning from simulations and training staffFollowing compliance or contractual obligationsGenerating artifacts for accreditationBeing agile – incremental improvementBecoming faster and improving toolsRefining communication and escalationDeveloping comfort with the rare and the unexpectedFor these reasons, the value derived from participating in a simulation activity increases an organization's effectiveness during stressful events. Developing a simulation activity that is both realistic and beneficial can be a difficult exercise. Although testing your procedures or automation that handles well-understood events has certain advantages, it is just as valuable to participate in creative Security Incident Response Simulations (SIRS) activities to test yourself against the unexpected and continuously improve.Create custom simulations tailored to your environment, team, and tools. Find an issue and design your simulation around it. This could be something like a leaked credential, a server communicating with unwanted systems, or a misconfiguration that results in unauthorized exposure. Identify engineers who are familiar with your organization to create the scenario and another group to participate. The scenario should be realistic and challenging enough to be valuable. It should include the opportunity to get hands on with logging, notifications, escalations, and executing runbooks or automation. During the simulation, your responders should exercise their technical and organizational skills, and leaders should be involved to build their incident management skills. At the end of the simulation, celebrate the efforts of the team and look for ways to iterate, repeat, and expand into further simulations.AWS has created Incident Response Runbook templates that you can use not only to prepare your response efforts, but also as a basis for a simulation. When planning, a simulation can be broken into five phases.Evidence gathering: In this phase, a team will get alerts through various means, such as an internal ticketing system, alerts from monitoring tooling, anonymous tips, or even public news. Teams then start to review infrastructure and application logs to determine the source of the compromise. This step should also involve internal escalations and incident leadership. Once identified, teams move on to containing the incidentContain the incident: Teams will have determined there has been an incident and established the source of the compromise. Teams now should take action to contain it, for example, by disabling compromised credentials, isolating a compute resource, or revoking a role's permission.Eradicate the incident: Now that they've contained the incident, teams will work towards mitigating any vulnerabilities in applications or infrastructure configurations that were susceptible to the compromise. This could include rotating all credentials used for a workload, modifying Access Control Lists (ACLs) or changing network configurations.;SEC10-BP07 Run game days;incident-response;sec_incident_response_run_game_days;Incident response;Simulate;Medium;Automated;Game days, also known as simulations or exercises, are internal events that provide a structured opportunity to practice your incident management plans and procedures during a realistic scenario.

This can speed up the lifecycle of a response. The next goal is to enable this code to be fully automated by being invoked by the alerts or events themselves, rather than by a human responder, to create an event-driven response. These processes should also automatically add relevant data to your security systems. For example, an incident involving traffic from an unwanted IP address can automatically populate an AWS WAF block list or Network Firewall rule group to prevent further activity.With an event-driven response system, a detective mechanism triggers a responsive mechanism to automatically remediate the event. You can use event-driven response capabilities to reduce the time-to-value between detective mechanisms and responsive mechanisms. To create this event-driven architecture, you can use AWS Lambda, which is a serverless compute service that runs your code in response to events and automatically manages the underlying compute resources for you. For example, assume that you have an AWS account with the AWS CloudTrail service enabled. If CloudTrail is ever disabled (through the cloudtrail:StopLogging API call), you can use Amazon EventBridge to monitor for the specific cloudtrail:StopLogging event, and invoke a Lambda function to call cloudtrail:StartLogging to restart logging.;SEC10-BP04 Automate containment capability;incident-response;sec_incident_response_auto_contain;Incident response;Iterate;Medium;Automated;Automate containment and recovery of an incident to reduce response times and organizational impact.Once you create and practice the processes and tools from your playbooks, you can deconstruct the logic into a code-based solution, which can be used as a tool by many responders to automate the response and remove variance or guess-work by your responders.
